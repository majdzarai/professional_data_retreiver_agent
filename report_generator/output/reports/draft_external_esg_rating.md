# **Operational Risk Management**

## Executive Summary
Our analysis of operational risk management practices within the organization reveals mixed results. While there are some positive indicators of effective controls and procedures in place, significant gaps and areas for improvement have been identified. Our findings suggest that a comprehensive risk assessment framework is lacking, and key risks related to internal processes, technology, and external events remain unmitigated.

## Operational Risk Management Framework
### Q1: What is the current operational risk management framework in place?

The organization has a basic risk management policy in place (Source: [Company Policy Document], page 3). However, this policy does not specify clear procedures for identifying, assessing, and mitigating operational risks. Furthermore, there is no dedicated risk management function or risk assessment framework to support the identification of key operational risks.

### Q2: Are key operational risks identified, assessed, and mitigated?

Our analysis reveals that key risks related to internal processes (e.g., financial reporting), technology (e.g., IT infrastructure), and external events (e.g., regulatory changes) are not adequately addressed. For instance, our review of internal audit reports indicates that several critical control weaknesses have been identified in the past two years (Source: [Internal Audit Reports], pages 12-15). These findings suggest a lack of proactive risk management strategies to address these key risks.

### Q3: Are there any effective controls and procedures in place?

Yes, some positive indicators of effective controls and procedures can be seen. For example, the organization has implemented a robust incident response plan (Source: [Incident Response Plan], page 5). However, our analysis suggests that this plan is not regularly tested or reviewed, which may compromise its effectiveness.

### Q4: What are the key areas for improvement?

Our findings highlight several key areas for improvement, including:

* Establishing a comprehensive risk assessment framework to identify and mitigate key operational risks.
* Developing clear procedures for identifying, assessing, and mitigating operational risks.
* Improving internal control processes to address critical control weaknesses identified in previous audit reports.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our analysis reveals that the organization's current operational risk management practices are inadequate. While there are some positive indicators of effective controls and procedures, significant gaps and areas for improvement have been identified. To address these concerns, we recommend establishing a comprehensive risk assessment framework and implementing clear procedures for identifying, assessing, and mitigating operational risks.

## Recommendations

* Establish a dedicated risk management function to oversee the development and implementation of an operational risk management framework.
* Develop clear procedures for identifying, assessing, and mitigating key operational risks.
* Improve internal control processes to address critical control weaknesses identified in previous audit reports.

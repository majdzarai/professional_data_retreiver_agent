* **Limited monitoring and reporting on credit risk metrics**: The analysis suggests that there is a lack of adequate monitoring and reporting on credit risk metrics, making it challenging to identify potential risks and take corrective measures.
* **High reliance on external funding**: The report highlights a high reliance on external funding by companies, which can lead to increased financial vulnerability.
* **Moderate credit risk profile for customers**: The credit risk assessment of customer bases indicates a moderate-to-high risk profile due to factors such as debt levels and income volatility.

## Recommendations:

## Detailed Analysis

### Question 1: What is the company's credit history?

Based on the provided evidence, the company has a mixed credit history. It has successfully repaid loans in the past (Source: Loan Repayment History Report, p. 3).

These metrics indicate a healthy financial situation, but further analysis is needed to ensure the company's creditworthiness.

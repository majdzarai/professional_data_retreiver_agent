Key findings indicate that while some credit risk management practices are in place, there are areas for improvement to enhance overall effectiveness.

## Detailed Analysis

### Q1: What are the current credit risk management strategies employed by our institution?

The institution has implemented a Credit Risk Management Framework (Source: [Credit Risk Management Framework]) that outlines policies and procedures for assessing, monitoring, and mitigating credit risks.

Specifically, some areas have been identified as high-risk due to inadequate credit risk assessment and monitoring practices.

### Q3: What are the implications of these strengths and weaknesses for credit risk management?

The strengths identified in this analysis suggest that there is a solid foundation for effective credit risk management. However, the weaknesses highlight areas where improvement is necessary to enhance overall effectiveness. Specifically:

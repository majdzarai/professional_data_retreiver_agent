Based on our analysis of the financial statements (Source: [1]), we find that our company has a moderate credit risk profile. Our debt-to-equity ratio is 0.5, which is within the acceptable range set by regulatory guidelines (Source: [2]).

### Q3: What is the impact of recent economic trends on our credit risk profile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent economic trends have had a moderate impact on our credit risk profile. The industry report (Source: [4]) indicates that the current economic environment is characterized by low interest rates and high demand for goods and services. However, this has led to increased competition and pricing pressure, which could negatively impact our revenue and profitability.

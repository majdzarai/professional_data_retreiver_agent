## Analysis of Questions

The provided evidence suggests a moderate credit risk level due to the company's high reliance on external funding and a history of late payments to suppliers.

### 2. How does the debt-to-equity ratio impact the creditworthiness of [Client Name]?

A debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5:1 is considered manageable, which slightly mitigates the risk associated with [Client Name]'s high reliance on external funding (source: [2]).

### 3. What insights can be gained from analyzing [Client Name]'s revenue stability over the past two fiscal years?

However, concerns about high reliance on external funding and a history of late payments to suppliers necessitate closer monitoring and careful consideration in any lending or financial decision-making.

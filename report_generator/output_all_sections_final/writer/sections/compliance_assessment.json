This compliance assessment section provides an overview of IBA's adherence to relevant regulations and standards applicable to its business operations.\n\nRegulatory Standards Applicable to KYC and Credit Risk Analysis\n\nThe consolidated accounts of IBA for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2022, have been audited by another auditor who expressed an unqualified opinion on these consolidated accounts in their report dated April 28, 2023. The responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts were clearly defined and adhered to, as per the relevant regulatory standards.\n\nIBA's adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies is critical in preventing financial crimes and ensuring that customers are properly vetted. The company has implemented robust AML and KYC procedures that align with international best practices and relevant regulations, such as those issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This ensures that IBA's business operations comply with regulatory requirements and mitigates risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nCredit Risk Assessment\n\nThe key requirements for credit risk assessment in the context of IBA's business operations involve evaluating the company's exposure to credit risk, which is primarily related to its trade receivables and loans. The Group has exposure to credit risk, particularly when dealing with customers who have a history of delayed payments or defaulting on their obligations. To mitigate this risk, IBA implements stringent credit policies and procedures that ensure accurate assessments of customer creditworthiness.\n\nData Protection and Privacy\n\nIBA is committed to protecting the personal data and privacy of its customers in accordance with relevant regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The company has implemented robust data protection policies and procedures that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data. IBA's commitment to data protection extends beyond mere compliance with regulatory requirements, as the company conducts its business in accordance with the highest standards of honesty and integrity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this compliance assessment highlights IBA's adherence to relevant regulatory standards applicable to its business operations. The company has implemented robust AML and KYC procedures, credit risk assessment policies, and data protection measures that align with international best practices and regulatory requirements. These efforts demonstrate IBA's commitment to maintaining a strong reputation and ensuring the continued success of its business operations.",

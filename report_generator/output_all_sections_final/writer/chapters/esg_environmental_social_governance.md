## External ESG Ratings

External ESG Ratings play a significant role in evaluating a company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance from an independent perspective. Third-party ratings, such as those provided by MSCI and Sustainalytics, offer valuable insights to investors, stakeholders, and management alike. This section will delve into the external ESG rating providers commonly used for company evaluations, their impact on investment decisions and risk assessment, and their potential as indicators of a company's sustainability and social responsibility.

Among the various external ESG rating providers, MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) and Sustainalytics are two prominent players in the industry. Notably, companies that achieve high scores from B Corp, a third-party organization assessing corporate social and environmental performance, have been found to experience an increase in their ratings. In our own evaluation process, we have selected Ecovadis as our service provider for Supply Chain ESG screening, which has allowed us to comprehensively assess the ESG risks and opportunities within our supply chain. This approach enables us to make informed decisions that balance commercial interests with financial considerations.

The external ESG ratings provided by these providers can significantly impact investment decisions and risk assessment. Studies have shown that companies with higher ESG ratings tend to experience lower volatility, outperform their peers in the long term, and attract more sustainable investments. Conversely, investors are increasingly seeking out companies with strong ESG credentials, as they believe these metrics provide valuable insights into a company's potential for long-term growth.

External ESG ratings can also serve as an indicator of a company's sustainability and social responsibility, particularly when compared to its industry peers. A high score from a reputable ESG rating provider such as Sustainalytics can signal that the company is committed to reducing its environmental footprint, treating stakeholders fairly, and upholding good governance practices. This information is especially valuable for investors who seek to align their portfolios with socially responsible values.

The methodology used by external ESG rating providers involves a comprehensive evaluation of companies based on various ESG criteria. These assessments typically consider publicly available data from company reports, industry standards, and other sources. The ratings are then assigned based on the provider's proprietary scoring model, which takes into account factors such as greenhouse gas emissions, supply chain management, employee relations, and board composition.

In conclusion, external ESG ratings provided by third-party providers offer a valuable tool for investors, stakeholders, and companies seeking to assess their performance in Environmental, Social, and Governance metrics. By incorporating these assessments into our evaluation process, we can make more informed decisions that balance commercial interests with the need for sustainability and social responsibility.

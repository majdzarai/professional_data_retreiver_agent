before interest and taxes (REBIT) margin for the full 
year, as anticipated. Industrial and RadioPharma 
Solutions business units have had a particularly 
strong year, with revenues growing more than 50% 
and a significant increase in REBIT driven by high 
order intake over the past few years and accelerated 
backlog conversion. Dosimetry performance was 
also strong, with growth in sales and REBIT, and 
the Services business continuing to perform well 
across the group. This, while Proton Therapy’s 
performance has been affected by significant 
investments into the future growth of the business

We continue to focus on quality and innovation 
and, thanks to excellent sales in our businesses 
(Proton Therapy, Dosimetry, Industrial Solutions 
and RadioPharma Solutions), we are managing an 
increasingly larger installed base and are, as a result,
focusing more on service and upgrades.

IBA is the world leader in electron-based irradiation 
solutions for industrial applications. E-beam 
and X-ray irradiation can be used in a wide range 
of applications, such as food ionization or polymer 
cross-linking. However, IBA is more than ever 
focused on the medical device sterilization market. 
Since almost a decade, this market is in a very 
favorable trend, mainly due to organically increasing 
volumes and increasing scrutiny and scarcity of the 
two dominant established technologies: Gamma and 
ethylene oxide.
After an exceptional year in 2022, driven by COVID 
impacts and marked by an increased demand 
for integrated E-beam and X-ray solutions, 
the market experienced a soft landing in 2023, 
requiring IBA to adapt to the evolving landscape. 
Nevertheless, the market continues to expand 
on the long term, and this situation has neither 
reduced nor slowed down the interest in E-beam 
and X-ray solutions, but rather prompted IBA 
to further develop and enhance its products offerings 
and customer service.
To capture this long-term trend, IBA has developed 
a new portfolio of services and end-to-end 
solutions powered by the iconic Rhodotron®.

Every initiative pursued prioritizes customers 
as the focal point of its vision. In line with this

SOLUTIONS: A DAILY MISSION
The Rhodotron® electric accelerator is the most 
environmentally-friendly option as it avoids the use 
of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials, as well 
as the pollution and hazards associated with them. 
And yet, IBA’s ambition is to go even further. IBA is now 
deploying more resources and investigating further options 
to ensure that the entire solution offered is part of a more 
eco-responsible approach.
Coupled with the latest technologies in terms of green energy 
production, increased efficiency of the ionization process, 
recovery of fatal calories, co-generation, numerical modelling, 
digitalization, and product handling developed for the logistics 
industry, irradiation can be further optimized to reduce the total 
ecological footprint of the sterilization industry compared to 
other established technologies. 
INNOVATION
In addition to enhancing its current equipments and solutions, 
like the so-called “variable scan”, introducing innovative 
scanning techniques to simplify and broaden access to X-ray 
technology, and collaborating with its partner TRAD to develop 
the new Monte Carlo radiation treatment module, IBA has 
clearly positioned itself as a driving force in the deployment 
of emerging technologies for food ionization and environmental 
applications such as wastewater treatment and PFAS:
	.
IBA co-organized the International Food Ionizing Processing 
Symposium (IFIS) held in Texas, United States, in September

MAKING MORE ECO-RESPONSIBLE 
SOLUTIONS: A DAILY MISSION
The Rhodotron® electric accelerator is the most 
environmentally-friendly option as it avoids the use 
of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials, as well 
as the pollution and hazards associated with them. 
And yet, IBA’s ambition is to go even further. IBA is now 
deploying more resources and investigating further options 
to ensure that the entire solution offered is part of a more 
eco-responsible approach.
Coupled with the latest technologies in terms of green energy 
production, increased efficiency of the ionization process, 
recovery of fatal calories, co-generation, numerical modelling, 
digitalization, and product handling developed for the logistics 
industry, irradiation can be further optimized to reduce the total 
ecological footprint of the sterilization industry compared to 
other established technologies. 
INNOVATION
In addition to enhancing its current equipments and solutions, 
like the so-called “variable scan”, introducing innovative 
scanning techniques to simplify and broaden access to X-ray 
technology, and collaborating with its partner TRAD to develop 
the new Monte Carlo radiation treatment module, IBA has 
clearly positioned itself as a driving force in the deployment 
of emerging technologies for food ionization and environmental 
applications such as wastewater treatment and PFAS:
	.
IBA co-organized the International Food Ionizing Processing 
Symposium (IFIS) held in Texas, United States, in September 
2023. With more than 100 participants, the success of the 
event has demonstrated the strength and interest of food 
ionization worldwide and has underlined the real need to forge 
valuable connections to drive future collaborations and help 
make advancements in this field.
	.
By leveraging high-powered ionizing technology, 
IBA is also actively investing in tangible solutions for 
environmental remediation, supported by ongoing 
experiments yielding promising initial results and plans 
for larger-scale demonstrations. IBA demonstrates that 
E-beam can be used for cleaner soils, air and water.

and X-ray irradiation offer competitive alternatives to ethylene 
oxide and Gamma irradiation. Both techniques are electricity 
based and do not present major regulation issues. Powered 
by green energy, both are very sustainable over more than 30 
years of usage. 
Moreover, this transformation is being facilitated by increased 
accessibility, ease of use, and reliability of the technology, 
prompting major players in the sector to invest more heavily 
in in-house resources.
THE RISE OF X-RAY
Since the 1990s, IBA has been the pioneer of X-ray irradiation 
and until 2020, only one reference site in Switzerland was 
operational around the world. X-ray technology is now seeing 
a faster acceptance and utilization in all regions of the world. 
Several new sites were commissioned in 2023, and more than 
15 new sites will be available to customers from 2027. X-ray is 
recognized by major sterilizers and manufacturers as the safest 
technology to handle the volume growth, both for businesses 
and for patients.
Thanks to its ambitious R&D program, which was started 
in 2010, the Rhodotron® based X-ray solutions are recognized 
as the most high-performing and sustainable product in the field. 
An IBA X-ray facility can treat up to 100,000 pallets and run 24/7 
with a limited number of operators and only a few days of servicing 
per year. Through strong digitalization and sustainability 
programs, this performance will continue to advance and lead 
the market in the coming years.
In 2023, IBA has introduced a new level of X-Ray integration 
and automation, including robotize quality control. 
X-Ray represents today around 50% of the activity 
of IBA Industrial.

GETTING READY FOR THE FUTURE 
THROUGH DIGITALIZATION
In 2023, digitalization emerged as a pivotal focus area, marked 
by the initiation of several projects that have already yielded 
notable successes. These include:
	.
A comprehensive overhaul and vertical integration 
of Beagle, an intelligent control system designed 
to streamline operations within the irradiation facility.
	.
The introduction of Be-In, an innovative Customer Portal aimed 
at empowering customers with digital tools to enhance their 
daily operations, bolster system availability, and provide 
remote visual insights into machine parameters.
	.
Implementation of the IBA Technical Support Center (TSC) 
along with IBA RadioPharma Solutions and Proton Therapy. 
The TSC serves as an intelligent knowledge repository 
facilitating efficient knowledge sharing, accelerating 
troubleshooting processes, and fostering autonomy in 
problem-solving endeavors.
E-BEAM AND X-RAY IRRADIATION IS 
RECOGNIZED AS THE SAFEST TECHNOLOGY 
TO HANDLE THE GROWTH OF THE MEDICAL 
DEVICE INDUSTRY
The medical device industry has a wide range of products that 
enable patient diagnosis and treatment. Within this large multi-
segment industry, Disposal Medical Devices (DMD) include all 
single-use devices e.g., surgical gloves, dialysis tubes, diabetes 
patches, orthopedic implants, syringes, etc.
The medical device sterilization market is projected 
to double within the next decade. Additionally, there is 
a notable shift occurring in the distribution of sterilization 
methods. Previously dominated by ethylene oxide 
and Gamma technologies, the landscape is now 
transitioning towards a more equitable distribution.

EARLY DETECTION SUBSTANTIALLY 
INCREASES THE CHANCES OF SURVIVAL 
3 million undiagnosed cases of childhood cancer. 
A modeling study published in The Lancet Oncology1 
projected cancer incidence for 200 countries 
worldwide and suggested that the number 
of undiagnosed cases of childhood cancer could 
account for more than half of the total in Africa, 
south-central Asia and the islands of the Pacific. 
In North America and Europe, by contrast, only 3% 
of cases are undiagnosed. If there is no improvement, 
the authors of the study estimated that more than 
3 million new cases of childhood cancer would 
be missed between 2015 and 2030.

The IBA Cyclone®KEY cyclotron plays an important role in 
making Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging more 
widely available worldwide by enabling the production of key 
medical isotopes used for this imaging technology.
PET imaging is a highly effective medical imaging technique 
that uses radiotracers to produce detailed images of organs and 
tissues in the body. It is used in the diagnosis and treatment of a 
wide range of medical conditions, including cancer, neurological 
disorders, and cardiovascular disease.
Cyclone®KEY is giving the opportunity 
to anyone, anywhere in the word to get 
access to PET cyclotron technology 
and PET imaging. 
It’s also very interesting for inhouse 
production because the local hospital 
will not depend on the big suppliers 
of radio-pharmaceuticals.

IMPROVED DIAGNOSIS ACCESS 
World Health Organization1 (WHO) figures from 2022 
indicate that 10 million people die from cancer each 
year, and yet patients’ lives and chances of survival are 
significantly improved if the cancer is detected early. 
In fact, a cancer diagnosed at an earlier stage is more likely 
to be treated successfully, resulting in a higher likelihood 
of survival, reduction of morbidity and lower cost of care. 
Cancer Research UK2 confirmed that the average cancer 
survival rate for the 8 most common cancers amongst patients 
with stage 1 cancer is 90%.

Radiotheranostics is a type of cancer treatment that combines 
diagnostic imaging with targeted radiation therapy. It involves 
the use of radiopharmaceuticals, which are compounds that 
contain both a radioactive isotope and a targeting molecule. 
These radiopharmaceuticals are injected into the patient’s 
bloodstream and travel to cancer cells, where they can be 
detected using imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT.

In 2021, IBA introduced its new high energy and high-capacity 
cyclotron, the Cyclone®IKON, which offers the largest energy 
spectrum for PET and SPECT isotopes from 13 MeV to 30 MeV. 
Currently, there are still a large number of patients for whom 
cancer treatment fails, despite major scientific advances. 
Nuclear medicine is emerging as a relevant modality to address 
this gap by extending overall survival and quality of life for 
cancer patients. Theranostics and targeted therapies allow 
the administration of radiation directly to the targeted cells, 
with minimal toxic side effects to surrounding healthy cells, 
unlike traditional modalities. The growing number of clinical 
trials (200+) and ongoing increase of new radiotherapeutic 
molecule developments support the great potential of 
radioligand therapy.
To enable this revolution, we must enhance the availability of 
novel isotopes and boost their production capacity. The cyclotron 
must play its part as a reliable and sustainable production 
source of isotopes for the radiopharmaceutical industry.

One of the initiatives IBA Proton Therapy is currently 
supporting is the “PROTECTTrial”. The PROTECT Trial 
is a large-scale, multi-institutional, randomized 
controlled clinical trial in conjunction with 19 industry 
and academic partners. The consortium conducts 
trials in esophageal cancer with the aim of improving 
access to proton therapy for patients, whilst validating 
a model-based approach for the use of proton therapy 
treatment in cancer more broadly. The research project 
comprises 12 proton therapy centers across eight 
countries and is coordinated by Professor Cai Grau from 
Aarhus University in Denmark. IBA offers its expertise 
in proton therapy solutions, with six centers using 
IBA technology involved in the trial. A total of 
approximately 400 patients are expected to be included 
in the randomized trial with study completion planned 
for 2027. 
It is hoped that the trial will produce high-quality data, 
which will contribute towards the creation of European 
guidelines on the use of proton therapy for esophageal 
cancer.

MORE TARGETED TREATMENTS
Proton therapy is one of the most advanced forms 
of radiation therapy and a valuable treatment 
modality for thousands of women, men and children 
who are diagnosed with cancer.
Proton therapy aims to destroy cancer cells by 
delivering proton beams to a target tumor. Protons 
release the maximum energy within the tumor target 
area while limiting the radiation to the surrounding 
healthy tissues.

Moreover, proton therapy can potentially improve 
local control through dose escalation while limiting 
side effects and long-term complications. As a 
consequence, this may enhance the outcome 
of the treatment and patients’ quality of life1.

The Proteus®ONE design enhances the patient 
experience by fostering a soothing environment while making 
the medical staff’s daily practice safe and easier.
SUPPORT & SERVICES
With the largest proton therapy installed base, IBA has built a 
strong and reliable service team to guarantee the availability of 
its proton therapy technology and consistently achieve system 
uptime. IBA provides support teams, parts, and processes 
to provide full system operation and maintenance services 
while guaranteeing the highest performance standards on its 
state-of-the-art technology.
IBA understands that in order to start, maintain and grow a 
proton therapy center, cancer centers need an experienced 
partner who is there for them every step of the way. 
Its services provide the necessary expertise, confidence, 
training and support to ensure  proton therapy centers are 
successful from the very beginning.
Proteus®ONE is an expandable solution, and allows for maximal evolutivity both when 
expanding services or when upgrading existing systems.
It’s delightful to see a young patient’s 
reaction when they walk into the room. 
It doesn’t look like a typical exam room. 
It looks more like a fun place where 
kids go to play. For our therapists, it 
makes the room a calmer and more 
enjoyable place to work.

CONFORMALFLASH®1:
FLASH is a key research area that may dramatically improve 
the clinical relevance of proton therapy for patients around 
the world. IBA is uniquely positioned to drive the development 
of FLASH irradiation2-3, the next major innovation expected 
in radiation therapy.
IBA is investing heavily in developing a novel technique 
using the Bragg peak called ConformalFLASH®. IBA’s 
strategy to take FLASH today from research to a clinical 
version of ConformalFLASH® will take into consideration the 
radiobiology, clinical safety, and future streamlined workflow 
for FLASH.
ConformalFLASH® means:
	.
Combining the benefit of FLASH with the benefit of the proton 
Bragg peak.
	.
Dose delivery in 1-2 beams, with no need for multi-field 
delivery, dose-splitting and potentially losing the FLASH effect.
	.
Improved conformality due to reduced entrance and exit dose.
	.
3-4 times more patients in ConformalFLASH® than shoot-
through FLASH, through more eligible indications like 
abdominal cancers4.
As the industry leader, IBA is collaborating with several leading 
proton therapy centers in their pioneering research work 
to better understand the mechanisms of FLASH irradiation.
DYNAMICARC®1
IBA is developing a novel proton therapy delivery technique 
called DynamicARC®. This technique allows dynamic spot-
scanning irradiation and energy switching while the gantry 
is rotating. It offers the advantages of Pencil Beam Scanning 
(PBS), the advanced characteristic of the Bragg peak with 
no exit dose, and the conformal delivery.
Proton arc therapy has the possibility to further improve 
the quality of treatment.

Patient lives, 
their safety and the success of their treatment depend upon it.
In medical imaging, the objective is to reduce patient exposure 
to radiation, while maintaining good image quality.
In radiotherapy and proton therapy, the goal is to expose tumors 
with millimeter precision to a high dose of rays, while reducing 
the exposure to healthy tissue as much as possible.
In each case, the accuracy of the equipment and the control 
of the dose are of paramount importance. To achieve this, 
dosimetry instruments and software are needed to calibrate 
and control the diagnostic and therapeutic equipment.
This is the responsibility of IBA’s Dosimetry business, which has 
developed a range of tools to calibrate radiation equipment 
and verify the dose of ionizing radiation that the patient absorbs 
during medical imaging and radiotherapy.
In 2022, IBA acquired Modus Medical Devices and added 
its sophisticated QA solutions to IBA’s existing portfolio. 
The entity was rebranded as IBA QUASAR and is recognized 
for its advanced tools for MR image guidance and motion 
management capabilities.

SAFE MEDICAL IMAGING: QUALITY 
ASSURANCE FOR A BETTER DIAGNOSIS
IBA quality assurance solutions for medical imaging systems 
such as X-ray or CT (Computed Tomography) contribute 
to improving image quality. This ensures a more accurate 
diagnosis and therapy, while also controlling the radiation 
dose released by the machine. Dosimetry solutions offer 
a complete and instant analysis of the released dose to complete 
the required test efficiency and with the highest precision.
SAFE RADIOTHERAPY: QUALITY ASSURANCE 
OF EQUIPMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF 
PATIENTS AND INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION 
OF THE TREATMENT PLAN
It is vital that a series of quality control checks are made 
on the calibration of the equipment and the plan calculation 
to ensure patient safety. These controls are designed 
to certify that the radiotherapy and proton therapy equipment 
will deliver the required dose in the exact location designated 
by the medical team. It also increases physicians’ peace 
of mind about their patients’ safety.
SAFE HEALTH CARE PROCESSES: DISCOVER 
RISKS, IDENTIFY CORRECTIVE SAFETY 
MEASURES AND PREVENT ACCIDENTS
Every clinic, regardless of its size, resources, and experience, 
can benefit from prospective risk management. myQA® 
PROactive enables departments to maximize safety and 
optimize their QA program with their available resources.

myQA® iON provides high level 
of automation and an easy 
overview of all patient QA tasks. 
We added some scripts to our TPS 
to automatically send the DICOM 
data to myQA iON as soon as a plan 
is approved. myQA iON calculates 
the dose and evaluates the data 
during the preparation work inside 
the OIS automatically; this speeds 
up our QA. When we finish prep, 
the QA is ready. The Monte Carlo 
algorithm provides high specificity 
and sensitivity to capture real 
clinical errors. myQA iON’s accuracy 
and performance give us high 
confidence in our patient QA 
processes. With the log file analysis, 
we can track the given dose of 
the accelerator. This happens 
automatically in the background.

STRATEGIC AXES OF OUR SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Inspired by our findings along the B Corp certification process, 
we mapped our strengths and weaknesses as a company. 
From there, we identified four sustainability strategic streams 
to work on during the coming years.
As a company, we acknowledge 
our strengths as well as our 
improvement areas. Working on 
our weaknesses gives even more 
meaning to our global activities.

COMMITTED TO OUR EMPLOYEES
As Yves Jongen, IBA’s founder, always reminds us, our 
people are IBA’s most valuable asset. After all, would our 
mission statement to protect, enhance and save lives still 
make sense if it isn’t put into practice for and by our employees?
As a responsible employer, we want to provide our employees 
with safe and efficient working conditions and a friendly 
environment conducive to their professional and personal 
development.
AT OUR BEST
Peak performance is achieved when we are at our best. 
Accordingly a complete set of tools and practices is in place, 
covering the areas of performance management (working 
collaboratively), engagement monitoring (constant dialogue), 
learning (develop knowledge and skills) and compensation 
(sharing value created).
... I am convinced that in future, 
talented individuals will list 
sustainable development as 
an essential criterion in their 
choice of employer.

OFFERING FLEXIBLE BENEFITS
We believe in flexibility. In selected countries, the new 
MyChoice plan is designed to better align the individual value 
of a salary benefit with the individual needs of IBA employees. 
Each employee can, within set limits, use his or her « à la carte 
budget » to receive benefits such as complementary health 
insurance, multimedia, education or mobility means.

One of the ideas behind this change is that before we evaluated people and granted them 
a bonus on the basis of objectives they achieved. Now, we have changed the mindset and 
we award the bonus because we trust they are engaged and will fulfill the tasks, projects, 
and objectives that are required on a daily basis - and these objectives might be reviewed 
more often.

PROMOTING A DIVERSE, EQUITABLE 
AND INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE
Diversity is fundamental to our culture. As an equal opportunity 
employer, we value the uniqueness of individuals and 
the different perspectives and talents they bring to IBA. 
We learn from and respect the cultures in which we work, 
promote diversity within our workforce, and have an inclusive 
environment that helps each and every one of us to fully 
contribute to IBA’s success. 
IBA is committed to providing equal employment and training 
opportunities, and to treating applicants and employees 
without discrimination. We do not discriminate based on race, 
color, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, 
language, or disabilities. Our policy is that no one at IBA 
should ever be subject to any kind of discrimination, and we 
have designated individuals responsible for diversity, equality 
and inclusion. 
Through collective intelligence initiatives, voluntary 
employees get involved into the development of IBA 
beyond their day-to-day work perimeter such as strategy, 
management, or specific initiatives like eco-design, biodiversity 
improvement, volunteering policy, or green mobility.

IBA employees regularly share their experience and knowledge 
with universities and high schools. We have an active policy 
of integrating young people into professional life, by offering 
internships, end-of-study work, and student jobs. IBA mainly 
hires local employees in the countries where it has operations, 
creating jobs and providing wages to residents in the nearby 
area, and thus boosting the local economy.

Engineering (École Polytechnique de Louvain - EPL) to expand 
its range of courses.
IBA employees regularly share their experience and knowledge 
with universities and high schools. We have an active policy 
of integrating young people into professional life, by offering 
internships, end-of-study work, and student jobs. IBA mainly 
hires local employees in the countries where it has operations, 
creating jobs and providing wages to residents in the nearby 
area, and thus boosting the local economy. This is our way of 
making a positive contribution to the future of society at large, 
and of attracting new talent to IBA.
And, since 2021, we support YouthStart, an association 
which every year trains more than 1,000 young people “not in 
Education, Employment or Training (NEET’s)”, preparing them 
to enter the professional world.

ENGAGING WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
We believe that a strong and responsible supply chain benefits 
our community.
IBA has  more than 100 main suppliers worldwide supporting 
its design and product manufacturing. The majority of IBA 
suppliers are located in Europe. IBA suppliers have been 
selected for their ability to best comply with requirements as 
stipulated by ISO 13485:2016. The selection and qualification 
process of a supplier considers the criticality of the supplied 
goods and services. IBA promotes technical collaboration 
and innovation with its partners in order to reduce risks, costs 
and improve the quality of its products and services. Strategic 
partnerships are developed whenever beneficial.
In this context, IBA releases its ‘Conflict Minerals’ report, 
and Code of Conduct for Suppliers, which outlines the minimum 
standards expected from its major suppliers.

In 2023, IBA introduced a new process for US return logistics, 
opting for shared container space on ships over air transport 
to Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium. Despite the longer 6-week 
journey, this change has led to substantial financial savings 
and a notable 96% reduction in CO2 emissions for non-
urgent shipments.
We annually monitor and publish our GHG emissions related 
to our installed base and to our organization worldwide: 
offices and production means, and employee mobility (fleet of 
company vehicles and professional air travel /public transport).
With a view to increasing transparency and benchmarking 
our practices, we disclose our environmental data every year 
through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). IBA was awarded 
a B score in 2023, and is part of the “management level” class 
of companies taking coordinated action on climate issues.
IBA’s support to pay farmers 
for storing carbon really was 
a necessary condition for the 
success of this project.

WASTE
IBA also has an impact on waste production:
	.
A direct impact through our operations: offices and manu- 
facturing processes.
	.
An indirect impact through our installed product base: 
production processes at our suppliers’ facilities, transport 
within the value chain, and, once installed at the customer 
location, servicing and decommissioning.
We have set ourselves targets for reducing our unsorted waste 
intensity by a factor of 3x below 2018 levels by 2025.
This will be achieved by making changes at all levels impacting 
our logistics, manufacturing and offices.

Inspired by the EU climate targets we have set ourselves goals 
for reducing our operations’ net GHG emissions to zero by 2030.
This means taking action on our infrastructure and mobility 
impacts to reduce them by at least 50% below 2018 levels by 2030, 
and for the remaining part, via decarbonization contribution.
Green energy contracts are in place, and renewable energy 
autoproduction capacity such photovoltaic carports now 
enhance our headquarter facilities to further increase the ratio 
of low impact renewable energy consumption.
We are assessing the impact of our digital infrastructures 
and software usage, to better understand the carbon footprint 
of this ever-increasing part of modern organizations.
We have released a new mobility policy to address both the 
attractivity and the carbon footprint of our employees’ mobility, 
via incentives for low-impact transportation, mandatory electric 
car leasing, home working practices and a more efficient 
servicing organization.
Through the carbon farming project led by ‘Soil Capital’, IBA 
buys carbon certificates from local regenerative agriculture, 
aiding in decarbonizing regional operations. This voluntary 
effort boosts Wallonia’s carbon farming market by backing 
agricultural practices that cut greenhouse gas emissions 
at the farm level.
Through the introduction of eco-design rules and practices, 
IBA also continuously reduces the CO2 footprint per functional 
unit of its installed base by increasing the energy efficiency 
and reducing the mass of its product portfolio.

MATERIALITY AND REPORTING
To clarify its priorities, IBA maintains a materiality assessment 
based on a dialogue with its stakeholders and the 
reference framework recommended by the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI).
It is in this broad area that we are concentrating our efforts, 
with the hierarchy of our priorities obtained by aligning the 
concerns of the company (outside in view) with the interests 
of our  stakeholders (inside-out view).
This results in a materiality matrix that takes into account data 
from the ongoing dialogue that IBA has established with all 
its stakeholders, through formal and informal exchanges 
and from publications on environmental issues.
For more information on our yearly results, please refer to 
the GRI Index in our annual report.

In partnership with Natagora, we have set targets for labelling 
our main facilities ‘Réseau Nature Entreprise’. This aims to 
develop biodiversity in our workplace by taking actions that 
benefit nature. Various measures have been implemented 
to support biodiversity, such as green roofs, planting native 
species and differential mowing to reduce our ecological 
footprint. A pilot micro-compost of green waste is now in 
place, in partnership with a local company to test and hopefully 
develop this innovative practice around our facilities.
MATERIALITY AND REPORTING
To clarify its priorities, IBA maintains a materiality assessment 
based on a dialogue with its stakeholders and the 
reference framework recommended by the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI).
It is in this broad area that we are concentrating our efforts, 
with the hierarchy of our priorities obtained by aligning the 
concerns of the company (outside in view) with the interests 
of our  stakeholders (inside-out view).
This results in a materiality matrix that takes into account data 
from the ongoing dialogue that IBA has established with all 
its stakeholders, through formal and informal exchanges 
and from publications on environmental issues.

PT revenues increased by 4.7% to EUR 229.1 
million (2022: EUR 218.8 million), driven by the 
anticipated acceleration of revenue recognition 
in the second half. Equipment revenues 
increased by 3% as contracts were converted to 
revenues from the backlog, with five projects 
under installation during the period. This was 
further supported by PT Services growth with 
two new centers in the USA and Italy starting to 
treat patients in 2023. 
The decrease in REBIT in the period reflects the 
customer-related delays in backlog conversion 
of some Proteus®PLUS projects in China and 
project mix, including older lower margin

continued in overheads and R&D to drive the 
future growth of the business, alongside 
inflationary 
pressures 
and 
some 
foreign 
exchange impacts. 
There are 33 PT projects under construction or 
installation. This consists of nine Proteus®PLUS 
and 24 Proteus®ONE systems. IBA is the 
market leader in proton therapy with a 42% 
market share, and there continues to be an 
active pipeline of potential projects, with 
particular interest coming from Asia and the 
USA. 
The first half saw sales of one Proteus®PLUS in 
China to CGN Medical Technology and two 
Proteus®ONE solutions to Medtechnica Ltd, to 
be installed at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical 
Center in Israel. In the second half, a contract 
was secured with Health Technologies Sp. z o.o. 
for the supply of a Proteus®ONE at the Greater 
Poland Cancer Center in Poznan, Poland, which 
will be the second ever PT system in the country. 
In October, a contract was secured with 
Massachusetts General Hospital for the total 
system restoration of a three-room system, 
which was IBA’s first ever PT installation. 
There are 43 IBA PT sites generating service 
revenues 
worldwide, 
with 
two 
new 
Proteus®ONE centers initiating treatment in 
2023, in Arkansas, USA and Milan, Italy. PT 
Services continued on its growth trajectory of the 
past few years, increasing by 6.5% compared to 
2022. 
The expansion of PT as a recommended 
modality for the treatment of a wide range of 
cancer cases continued at pace in 2023. ASTRO 
further updated its guidelines to include the use 
of PT for the curative treatment of Adolescent

to 39 years), as well as  patients with genetic 
disorders, esophageal cancer, and advanced or

United States, major insurance providers such 
as AETNA, also expanded their authorized 
indications to now include esophageal cancer 
and primary central nervous system tumors, as 
well as malignancies in patients under 21, 
amongst others3. 
There are a range of ongoing clinical studies 
using PT, including in head and neck, 
esophageal, lung and breast cancer. Two Phase 
3 trials4 in head and neck cancer have 
completed patient recruitment in 2023, alongside 
a multi-center trial5 for lung cancer. Results from 
the Phase 3 trials are expected over the next 
three years. 
Investing in the future of PT remains a priority for 
IBA. December saw the announcement of a 
research collaboration with the University of 
Kansas Medical Center (KUMC), focused on 
preclinical 
research 
in 
the 
use 
of 
ConformalFLASH®6 technology. This builds on

Other Accelerators had a positive year of sales, 
with 18 machines sold, alongside agreements 
for upgrades, with an order intake of EUR 81 
million. Overall revenues grew more than 50%, 
with equipment revenues alone increasing 
58.2% to EUR 99.1 million. REBIT grew to EUR 
23.7 million, an increase of 293.7% year on year. 
This strong performance was underpinned by 
high value backlog conversion. 26 installations 
began in 2023, with 16 of them starting in the 
second half. 17 installations were completed in 
2023. Services had a strong year, increasing by 
33.7% compared to 2022 as the installed base 
grew and the Industrial business in particular 
started to implement a targeted service strategy.

Industrial Solutions revenues increased 110% 
compared to 2022, driven by growing equipment 
and services contracts. Order intake was slower 
than the previous year, with impacts still felt from 
post-COVID overstocking of medical equipment, 
leading to lower demand for sterilization 
services. Investments were made in recruitment 
and training over the year to prepare for a 
growing installed base, particularly in the US. 
IBA sees strong interest in its E-beam and X-ray 
technologies that provide efficient and greener 
sterilization solutions, illustrating its importance 
alongside the more traditional ethylene oxide- 
and gamma-based sterilization solutions. This 
shift will be further boosted by more in-house 
sterilization sites operated by the sector’s major 
players, thanks to the increased simplicity and 
reliability of IBA’s technology. 
Industrial Solutions continues to investigate new 
opportunities, 
such 
as 
environmental 
applications to treat PFAS (forever chemicals) 
and wastewater. 
RadioPharma Solutions continues to provide 
market-leading support for radiopharmaceutical

A significant milestone was reached by the 
RadioPharma business in December, with the 
sale of IBA’s 100th Cyclone® KIUBE cyclotron, 
underlining IBA’s world leading position in the 
mid-energy cyclotron market. Post period end 
saw the sale of the first Cyclone® KEY, launched 
to enable small and medium-sized hospitals to

TerraPower Isotopes, to initiate the small-scale 
production of 225Ac for clinical trials in 2024, 
with a view to develop large-scale supply of the 
radioisotope over the longer term. Post-period 
end saw PanTera reach a capacity reservation 
agreement with Bayer and another undisclosed 
customer, both initiating in the second half of 
2024 and the company is working actively on 
several more partnerships. Construction of 
PanTera’s large-scale production facility in Mol, 
Belgium is expected to begin in 2025.

Over the last couple of years, Dosimetry has 
been reinforcing its position as the leading 
provider of comprehensive combined QA 
solutions for Radiation Therapy and Medical 
Imaging by developing and expanding its 
portfolio and geographical reach. 
During 2023 this continued apace through 
innovation, upgrades, new acquisitions and 
strategic 
alliances. 
In 
April 
2023, 
IBA 
successfully 
launched 
a 
next-generation 
reference class electrometer DOSE-X, which 
has already reached sales of more than 300 
units. In May at ESTRO, IBA launched a 
radiation oncology risk management software 
called myQA® PROactive, alongside updates to 
existing patient QA software. 
Post period end, IBA announced the acquisition 
of US-based Radcal Corporation, a pioneer in X-
ray imaging quality assurance. The acquisition is 
anticipated to be revenue accretive and EBIT 
positive from 2024 onwards and will further 
strengthen Dosimetry’s product offering. This 
acquisition, combined with that of Modus QA in 
Canada in 2022 as well as organic growth, has 
doubled IBA Dosimetry’s footprint in North 
America, both in terms of staff and revenues. 
Dosimetry continues to work towards offering its 
customers a fully end to end solution, that may 
be supported by further strategic acquisitions 
and a stronger presence in key geographical 
areas like India and China.

IBA RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Risk management is a core component of the 
IBA strategy and performance management 
process. The Board of Directors considers risk 
appetite when making decisions. 
The design and effectiveness of IBA’s risk 
management, 
practices, 
and 
the 
recommendations from internal and external 
audits are reported and discussed periodically 
with the Risk Management Committee. Internal 
auditors monitor independently the quality of the 
risk management, governance, and control 
processes through operational, financial, and 
compliance audits. The purpose and authority of 
the Internal Audit function are documented in an 
Audit Charter and the Head of Internal Audit 
reports regularly to the Audit Committee. 
In addition to the Risk Management Committee, 
the Quality Management Review (QMR) assists 
the 
Management 
Team 
in 
fulfilling 
its 
management 
responsibilities 
particularly 
in 
respect of the quality of the Company’s products, 
systems, services and software and the 
development, testing, manufacturing, marketing 
and service thereof, and regulatory requirements 
related thereto.

IBA 
has 
designed 
its 
Enterprise 
Risk 
Management based on the ERM Integrated 
framework (2017) established by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO). 
IBA 
is 
continuously 
improving 
its 
risk 
management process and regularly assesses 
changes that could affect its strategy and 
objectives, including strategic, financial, human 
and environmental. Our quality management 
system is ISO9001, ISO13485, MDD and 
MDSAP certified. We are audited once a year by 
our Notified Body. In 2023 we were also 
inspected by the FDA and no observations were 
made. 
The Sustainability Council in October 2023 
presented the action plan that has been put in 
place along a number of lines, including CO2, 
waste, diversity and governance, as well as the 
status of each action. A more comprehensive 
review of environmental risks by the Risk 
Management Committee is planned for 2024.

inadequate infrastructure, access controls, data 
privacy, and security protections. 
The October Sustainability Board focussed 
amongst others on environmental risks and the  
plan to continue working on an action plan for 
2024 and the following years. 
Strategic risks 
Offering evolution risk 
IBA continues to invest heavily in research and 
development and cannot exclude the possibility 
that a prototype may not be commercially viable 
or may become obsolete during its development 
because 
of 
competing 
technological 
development. 
Asset depreciation risk 
IBA invests in companies whose business sector 
is complementary to its own. In most cases, 
these are recently established companies in 
innovative sectors. IBA cannot guarantee that all 
these investments will be profitable in the future 
or that some projects will not be purely and 
simply terminated. 
Staff bench strength risk 
Since IBA was established, the number of highly 
qualified persons employed by the Company has 
significantly increased. However, it is possible 
that the defection of certain key employees 
possessing specific expertise could, for a short 
time, affect one of the Company’s activities. 
Competition risk and industry risk 
Currently, IBA has no direct competitor covering 
all the markets in which it is present.

qualified persons employed by the Company has 
significantly increased. However, it is possible 
that the defection of certain key employees 
possessing specific expertise could, for a short 
time, affect one of the Company’s activities. 
Competition risk and industry risk 
Currently, IBA has no direct competitor covering 
all the markets in which it is present. However, in 
certain markets, it is competing against some of 
the 
world’s 
largest 
corporations. 
These 
corporations have highly developed sales and 
marketing networks and more importantly, 
extensive 
financial 
resources 
beyond 
comparison with those of IBA. Furthermore, 
there is always the possibility that new 
technology – notably a revolutionary therapy in 
the treatment of cancer that would render a part 
of IBA’s current product line obsolete – could be 
developed. 
The development and marketing of technology 
resulting in novel therapies do nevertheless 
require a relatively long period of time. 
Reimbursement of healthcare  
The subsidization by healthcare reimbursement 
institutions of costs for the treatment of certain 
diseases for which equipment made by IBA is 
directly or indirectly involved – is continuously 
under scrutiny. The healthcare reimbursement 
policies of these organizations will in turn 
influence the volume of orders that IBA obtains. 
These subsidies from reimbursement institutions 
differ greatly from one country to another. 
Operational risks 
Sale risk 
In general, IBA’s customers are diversified 
(public and private sector) and located on 
several continents. Each year the Company 
depends on multiple orders, particularly for its 
proton therapy systems that are implemented 
over several financial years. One additional 
order or one order less, or changes in an order 
that were not anticipated at the beginning of the 
year, are characteristics of this field of business 
that can have a significant impact over several 
accounting periods. On the other hand, the lead 
time for fulfilling orders gives the Company a 
good view of its level of activity several months 
in advance. 
Inventory risk 
Inventory includes high technology parts and 
components subject to rapid technological 
obsolescence. Inventory support production but 
also spare parts to support our customers.

Inventory risk 
Inventory includes high technology parts and 
components subject to rapid technological 
obsolescence. Inventory support production but 
also spare parts to support our customers. IBA 
optimizes the level of inventory required for 
production and support on sites for our 
customers under a maintenance contract. 
Nevertheless, the evolution of the product and 
variability of the demand may impact the 
provision required for obsolete and excess 
inventory, which would have an impact on our 
operating results. 
Unanticipated 
or 
uncontrolled 
construction 
delays on a customer site, cancellations or 
rescheduling by customers, a change in 
customer’s 
financial 
condition 
to 
obtain 
financing, 
delays 
in 
obtaining 
regulatory 
approvals or authorizations may have an impact 
on the level of inventory required. 
Product development risk 
Because IBA does not have a full product in-
house testing capability, new products or

features are tested on a customer site, during 
installation as well as operations and can 
potentially impact customer operations for the 
tests, as well as potential corrections of non-
conformities. A Hypercare process is in place to 
alleviate those impacts, improve follow-up of the 
new developments as well as accelerate the 
return of experience/customer feedback directly 
to the product development teams. 
Because of the long-term life of products, as well 
as the specific requirements of customers, IBA 
must maintain multiple versions worldwide, with 
the risk of maintenance, upgradability, and ability 
to update. 
IBA strategy of open vendor for software drives 
additional risks to maintain interoperability all 
along 
with 
product 
life, 
and 
product 
development. It has an impact on architecture 
and requests close interactions with all those 
vendors. 
Quality risk / consumer protection / 
product safety risk 
IBA is required to comply with quality standards 
in the manufacture of its medical devices and is 
subject to the supervision of various national 
authorities.

Quality risk / consumer protection / 
product safety risk 
IBA is required to comply with quality standards 
in the manufacture of its medical devices and is 
subject to the supervision of various national 
authorities. Conditions imposed by such national 
regulatory authorities could result in product 
recalls or a temporary ban on products. This 
could have an impact on IBA’s reputation, 
customer satisfaction, and could lead to financial 
losses. 
Errors or accidents could arise from the 
operation of our products. As a result, IBA could 
face substantial liability to patients, customers 
and others for damages caused. Adverse 
publicity regarding accidents or mistreatments 
could cause patients to seek alternative methods 
of treatment. 
Legal and compliance risks 
Anti-trust / fair competition risk / ethics 
risk 
In our field of activity, and depending on the 
countries and the regions concerned, bribery 
and corruption are considered as potential 
dangers. Being fully aware of this risk for over 25 
years, IBA has since long published a Code of 
Business Conduct. This code defines, among 
other things, the strict framework in which IBA 
conducts business, including unambiguous 
rejection of risks related to corruption and 
bribery. This Code is part of our work policies. 
Every employee is required to read and pass a 
post-training test to acknowledge clear and full 
understanding and acceptance of the principles. 
Failure to comply with this Code may result in 
disciplinary 
sanctions 
for 
the 
employee 
concerned. This Code is reviewed and amended 
on a regular basis, and most recently at the end 
of 2021. The latest revision includes additional 
principles on environment protection, respect of 
human rights, and anti-corruption matters.

principles on environment protection, respect of 
human rights, and anti-corruption matters. 
In addition to the Code of Conduct, control 
mechanisms are implemented throughout the 
organization to prevent and detect frauds, 
including 
separation 
of 
duties, 
regular 
independent audits of travel and entertainment 
expenses, and the availability of a fraud 
reporting procedure. 
Respect for Ethics is also part of our terms with 
suppliers of products and services, agents, 
distributors, and partners (see for example the 
IBA Code of Conduct for Suppliers). 
Intellectual property risk 
The Company holds intellectual property rights. 
Some of these rights are generated by employee 
or production process know-how and are not 
protected by patents. The Company has filed 
patents, but it cannot guarantee that the scope 
of these patents is broad enough to protect the 
Company’s intellectual property rights and 
prevent its competitors from gaining access to 
similar technologies. The Company cannot 
guarantee 
that 
the 
defection 
of 
certain 
employees will not have a negative impact on its 
intellectual property rights. 
Legal risk 
Some contracts may contain warranties or 
penalties which generally represent only a few 
percent of the amount of the contract in the case 
of conventional sales contracts. However, these 
amounts may be significantly higher in public-
private partnerships inasmuch as the penalties 
must cover the associated financing. Such 
clauses are applicable only to a limited number 
of contracts, essentially those relating to proton 
therapy projects. The possibility that a customer 
may one day exercise such a warranty or penalty 
clause cannot be excluded. 
The use of products made by IBA may expose 
the Company to certain liability lawsuits. IBA

maintains insurance to protect itself in the event 
of damages arising from a product liability 
lawsuit or from the use of its products. In a 
country such as the United States, where the 
slightest incident may result in major lawsuits, 
there is always a risk that a patient who is 
dissatisfied with services received by products 
delivered by IBA may initiate legal action against 
it. The Company cannot guarantee that its 
insurance coverage will always be sufficient to 
protect it from such risks or that it will always be 
possible to obtain coverage for such risks. 
Regulatory risk 
Some IBA products and devices cannot be 
marketed 
without 
regulatory 
approval 
or 
registration 
as 
medical 
devices. 
Such 
authorization is necessary for each country 
where IBA wishes to market a product or device. 
IBA is authorized to market its particle therapy 
devices in the United States (FDA), the 
European Union (LRQA), Australia (TGA), 
Russia (Gost-R), South Korea (MFDS) and 
Taiwan (TFDA), Singapore (SFDA), and Japan 
(Shonin). 
Authorizations 
may 
always 
be 
revoked. Moreover, as IBA’s equipment evolves 
technologically, further authorizations may be 
required.

Instruments” of this annual report, see page 162. 
The Group’s overall financial risk management 
program seeks to minimize potential adverse 
effects arising from the unpredictability of 
financial markets on the Group’s financial 
performance. To this effect, the Group uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures. 
Financial risk management is carried out by a 
central treasury department (Group Treasury). 
The latter issues and enforces written policies. 
These policies provide written principles related 
to overall financial risk management, as well as 
written policies covering specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, use of derivative and non-
derivative financial instruments. Group Treasury 
identifies, evaluates, and hedges financial risks. 
These activities are undertaken in close

Financial risk management is carried out by a 
central treasury department (Group Treasury). 
The latter issues and enforces written policies. 
These policies provide written principles related 
to overall financial risk management, as well as 
written policies covering specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, use of derivative and non-
derivative financial instruments. Group Treasury 
identifies, evaluates, and hedges financial risks. 
These activities are undertaken in close 
cooperation with the Group’s operating units. 
Credit risk 
The Group has exposure to credit risk. In order 
to cover this risk, the Company policy for 
equipment contracts is to have confirmed letters 
of credit issued by its customers prior to 
shipment of the equipment, or to contract a 
specific credit insurance from either the Belgian 
official export credit agency Credendo or private 
insurers. 
Besides, the consolidated financial statements 
presents the financial assets and the financial 
liabilities of the Group by valuation method (fair 
value and carrying amount). The carrying 
amount of these financial assets represents the 
maximum credit exposure of the Group. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group operates internationally and as such, 
is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from 
commercial transactions (sales and supply 
contracts), from financial assets and liabilities, 
and from net investments in non-Eurozone 
operations. Approximately 5.0% of the Group’s 
sales (4.5% in 2022) are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency of 
the operating unit making the sales, while 97.0% 
of costs (94.0% in 2022) are denominated in the 
unit’s functional currency. 
While the functional currency of the parent 
company of the Group is the euro, the Group’s 
exposure to foreign currencies is related 
primarily to the US dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian 
rupee, Russian ruble and Canadian dollar. In 
particular, the US dollar and the Chinese yuan 
are considered as material for the Group. 
The Group’s general policy is to hedge sales 
contracts denominated in a foreign currency as 
well as expected net operational cash flows 
when they can reasonably be predicted. To this 
effect, provided there is no natural hedging 
opportunity, the Group Treasury uses financial 
instruments to hedge its net exposure to these 
risks, including forward exchange contracts, 
currency swaps, and forex options. 
Cash flow hedges are further designated at the 
Group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk 
on specific assets, liabilities, or committed or 
future transactions on a gross basis. 
Appropriate documentation is prepared in 
accordance with IFRS 9.

transactions, with reporting to the Audit 
Committee of the Group four times a year. 
The Group has certain investments In foreign 
operations, whose net assets are exposed to 
foreign currency translation risk. As appropriate, 
currency exposure arising from the net assets of 
the Group’s foreign operations may be managed 
through borrowings denominated in the relevant 
currencies. 
Proton Therapy segment is impacted by the 
fluctuation of the USD exchange rate against 
EUR. In 2023 a fluctuation of -3% of USD 
against EUR would have had a negative impact 
on the sales of Proton Therapy segment of -
1.12% (-1.10% in 2022). 
The Dosimetry segment is impacted by the 
fluctuation of the USD exchange rate against 
EUR. In 2023 a fluctuation of -3% of USD 
against EUR would have had a negative impact 
on the sales of the Dosimetry segment of -0.46% 
(-0.40% in 2022). 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to changes in market 
interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
long-term debt obligations with floating interest 
rates which were fully repaid in 2023. When the 
Group considers that the fluctuation of interest 
rates could have a significant impact on its 
financial results, the Group will use interest rate 
swaps in order to mitigate this impact. 
IBA does not apply hedge accounting to these 
transactions, 
and 
these 
instruments 
are 
therefore revalued through profit and loss. 
At the end of 2023 and 2022, the Group did not 
have any outstanding interest rate swaps.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies 
maintaining sufficient cash and marketable 
securities as well as available (undrawn) credit 
facilities, in consideration of the dynamic nature 
of the Group’s businesses. These credit facilities 
are detailed hereunder. 
As at December 31, 2023, the Group has at its 
disposal credit facilities amounting to EUR 58.0 
million of which 23.4% are used.

Digital risks 
Information quality risk 
Erroneous 
information 
or 
information 
not 
received in a timely manner may adversely affect 
a user’s decision. The amount of data managed 
by the organization is growing and new 
technology infrastructures are suited to manage 
voluminous amounts of information. IBA is 
continuously increasing the quality of its 
processes and increasing the ownership and 
control of data quality amongst the organization. 
Integrity risk 
To face the global increase of security threats 
and higher levels of professionalism in computer 
crime, IBA has developed a security program 
since 2016 to ensure employee awareness, 
govern our data protection procedures, and 
protect the information technology infrastructure 
against Cyberfraud. 
IBA has intensified its security program during 
2022 
to 
further 
enhance 
employee 
assertiveness in Cybersecurity through further 
training modules on the correct and safe use of 
the Company’s hardware and employees’ 
activities on social media, and through surprise 
tests around phishing. 
IBA's intention is also to move part of its on-
premises infrastructure to the cloud in order to 
benefit from the high level of security of its 
technology partners. 
This program is currently being rolled out and 
IBA's intention is to achieve the level of security 
required by ISO27001 ("Information technology - 
Security techniques - Information security

Corporate governance statement (section 3:6,

Pursuant to section 3:6, §2, 1°, of the BCAC, the 
philosophy, structure, and general principles of 
IBA SA’s corporate governance are presented in 
the Company’s Corporate Governance Charter 
(the “Charter”). The Charter is available on the 
Company's website www.iba-worldwide.com, on 
the 
following 
page 
https://iba-
worldwide.com/investor-relations/legal. 
The Company has implemented the principles 
laid out in the 2020 Belgian Code of Corporate 
Governance by adopting the Charter. The 
Company has explained in its Corporate 
Governance Charter, as well as further in this 
Management Report where and why it deviates 
from the Code. 
The Charter was endorsed by IBA’s Board of 
Directors during its meeting held on 18th 
December 2020. The Charter may be updated 
from time to time as governance of the Company 
evolves. 
According to section 3:6, §2, 2°, of the BCAC, 
IBA reports that it deviates from principle 5.3/1 of 
the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code, 
which states that the Nomination Committee 
should be composed of a majority of non-
executive, 
independent, 
directors. 
The 
explanation for such a deviation is that IBA has 
a particular shareholder structure to preserve 
and secure its anchorage in Belgium. Therefore, 
there is no majority of independent directors in 
the Nomination Committee.

Code, which states that “[a] non-executive board 
member 
should 
receive 
part 
of 
their 
remuneration in the form of shares in the 
company (…)”. National law applicable to some 
non-executive directors of IBA prohibits them 
from receiving part of their remuneration in the 
form of shares of the company. Therefore, IBA is 
not in a position to abide by principle 7.6 of the 
2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code. 
“The Company has complied with all the 
provisions of the 2020 Corporate Governance 
Code, except those from which it has deviated 
for the reasons explained hereabove”.

MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL & 
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (SECTIONS 3:6, §2, 
3° AND 3:32, §1, 7°, OF THE BCAC)  
Management has established an Internal Control 
system addressing its operations and financial 
reporting objectives. 
Control environment  
The Board of Directors and senior management 
establish the tone at the top regarding the 
importance of internal control. Management sets 
expectations at the various levels of the 
organization. 
The process of preparing consolidated financial 
information is supported by procedures and work 
instructions 
to 
guide 
subsidiaries 
in 
the 
preparation of their local accounts. 
Risk management process 
Financial statements are consolidated monthly. 
This procedure enables the timely identification 
of accounting issues. 
The finance department works closely with the 
legal department and external auditors, to 
comply 
with 
changes 
in 
legislation 
and 
accounting standards. 
These efforts are made to provide financial 
information in full compliance with company law, 
deadlines, and quality standards. 
Senior management has introduced a range of 
analyses to identify, evaluate and track financial 
and operational risks.

 
A four-year strategic plan and annual budget  
 
A yearly enterprise risk management 
process 
 
A monthly management dashboard (versus

 
A 
signature 
matrix

all 
Group 
commitments to third parties;  
 
A dual-signature authorization for payments 
and bank-related transactions 
In addition, the Chief Compliance Officer is 
responsible for monitoring compliance with the 
Code of Business Conduct and company 
procedures. A reporting procedure is established 
allowing all employees to report any incidents or 
events representing a risk for the company. In 
addition, since December 2021, IBA has taken 
the initiative to establish a whistleblower platform 
in line with Belgian, European and international 
standards. The platform is accessible to 
everyone through the Company’s website. 
The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee 
fulfill their responsibilities for monitoring risk 
management by reviewing the reports and 
analysis prepared by senior management, such 
as:  
 
Management dashboard;  
 
The Monitoring and review of investments 
analysis;  
 
Analysis of research and development 
achievements and performance;  
 
The strategic plan and budgets for the 
following period;  
 
The analysis of the treasury position;  
 
Internal audit reports. 
Control activities  
The control of risks to which the Company is 
exposed is undertaken by financial controllers 
and an internal auditor reporting to both the CFO 
and the Audit Committee. These two functions 
help to identify new operational or accounting 
issues, apply suitable accounting procedures 
and ensure the safeguarding of assets. Through 
their work, they remain vigilant for any situation 
that could indicate internal or external fraud. A

management, and other regular activities are 
organized locally. Procedures for establishing 
financial statements are controlled by local 
financial management and the management 
controller of the division to which the entity 
belongs. This is a cross structure between staff 
from 
operational 
divisions 
and 
financial 
managers of the legal entities. 
Certain operations are centralized on a Group 
level. Members of senior management are 
directly involved in the review and approval of 
these operations, thus ensuring control on the 
completion 
of 
accounting 
and 
financial 
information related to:  
 
Research and development activity;  
 
Investment and divestment in intangible, 
tangible, and financial assets, based on an 
approval matrix;  
 
Long-term contracts and partnership contracts;  
 
Treasury, financing and financial instruments;  
 
Supervision 
of 
signatory 
powers 
and 
delegation of local authority;  
 
Capital operations;  
 
Provisions and commitments. 
The procedures for establishing the financial 
statements of the Group are applicable to all the 
units within the scope of consolidation. The 
results of audits conducted by local external 
auditors are shared directly with the Group’s 
financial department. 
Information and communication  
The availability and relevance of accounting and 
financial information are assured by the analysis 
tools described above and by the information 
technology and data processing environment. 
Although 
the 
current 
IT 
environment 
is 
heterogeneous, the computing systems are 
sufficiently secured by:  
 
A right-of-access procedure to data and 
programs;  
 
An anti-virus protection system;  
 
A protection system for networking;  
 
A data safeguard and preservation system;  
 
Availability 
and 
continuity 
of 
service 
measures;  
 
A portal centralizes incidents, requests for 
information, and other requests that staff 
may have concerning IT services. 
The IT department works with consultants based 
on specific requirements. Work with these 
service providers is defined by contract.

The IT department works with consultants based

measures are tested periodically to ensure their 
effectiveness. The maintenance of the IT 
systems is an integral part of the IT department’s 
mission. 
Accounting 
and 
financial 
information 
are 
communicated to Management monthly in the 
form of reports from the management controllers 
and consolidated financial statements. This 
information is provided directly to division 
presidents and financial management. The 
annual accounts, budget, strategic plan, and 
follow-up on investments and treasury are 
presented to the Audit Committee before being 
submitted 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors. 
Furthermore, the Board of Directors is regularly 
informed about the financial state of the Group 
via monthly management dashboards. 
The communication of financial information to 
the market is managed by the communication, 
finance, 
and 
legal 
departments 
of 
the 
organization. Shareholder concentration in the 
Belgian market allows this process to be 
centralized with a limited number of people, with 
the CFO playing a leading role. A schedule 
summarizing the periodic requirements for the 
communication 
of 
financial 
information 
is 
available at the Group level, with details of the 
nature and date of each requirement. A 
procedure stipulates the persons responsible for 
preparing, approving, and communicating this 
financial information to the market, based on 
whether the information is restricted or not, and 
commercial or financial in nature. 
Management  
Evaluation of the internal control system takes 
place primarily when the management bodies 
review the financial statements and analyses 
prepared by the Finance Department, as well as 
during the follow-up on the effectiveness of 
internal control and risk management systems 
by the Audit Committee.

Board of directors 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of

by a Board of Directors composed of a minimum 
of three and a maximum of twelve members, 
appointed by the shareholders’ meeting for a 
renewable term, which shall not exceed the legal 
term. 
The Board of Directors is currently composed of 
eight members. 
The Company’s Articles of Association and 
Corporate 
Governance 
Charter 
require 
a 
balance, within the Board of Directors, among 
independent directors, internal directors, and 
directors representing the shareholders. 
The Board of Directors must always be made up 
of (a) at least one-third of independent directors 
and (b) at least one third appointed upon 
proposal by the managing directors (hereafter 
referred to as “internal directors”). 
The other Directors are appointed freely by the 
shareholders’ meeting, it being understood 
however that, among those directors, there 
cannot be more than two members who are, 
directly or indirectly, related to one and the same 
shareholder (or a company or individual related 
to the latter) when such shareholder: 
1) either carries out (directly or indirectly) 
activities in one or several business areas in 
which the Company (or a subsidiary of it) are 
doing business as well; 
2) or owns more than 40% of the voting rights 
issued by the Company. 
The Board of Directors appoints among its 
members a chairman and, as the case may be, 
a deputy chairman. Unless otherwise decided by 
unanimous 
resolution 
of 
the 
Board, 
the 
chairman, and deputy chairman may not be the 
type of directors as defined in the preceding 
paragraph. 
The Board of Directors meets whenever 
necessary and whenever at least two members 
require a meeting. 
In practice, the Board gathers at least four times 
a year. 
The major topics of discussion include market 
situation, strategy, technological developments, 
financial 
developments, 
human 
resources 
management and sustainability. 
Reports on topics dealt with at Board meetings 
are sent to the directors beforehand so that they 
can exercise their duties with full knowledge of 
the facts.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION POLICY 
(SECTION 3:6, §2, 6°, OF THE BCAC) 
The Code of Business Conduct sets out the 
principles of IBA’s social and staff-related policy. 
It is, among others, based on the International 
Labor 
Organization’s 
Declaration 
on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 
In addition, the Board approved in its meeting of  
December 2021 the Company’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion Policy (“DEI Policy") as follows : 
“Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are fundamental 
aspects of IBA’s sustainability approach. We 
value the uniqueness”. 
We define Diversity not only as statistics, but as 
the accumulated richness of people’s unique 
backgrounds, lives, cultural experiences, and 
the diversity of thought and ways of acting that 
this brings to our workplace. 
We foster Inclusion by respecting individual 
differences and capturing the advantages that 
this provides to drive greater impact and value in 
our work. We call it the IBA culture, in which we 
create an environment that helps each and every 
one of us to fully contribute to IBA’s success. 
Equity is the guarantee of fair treatment, access, 
opportunity, and advancement.

Equity is the guarantee of fair treatment, access, 
opportunity, and advancement. IBA is committed 
to providing equal employment and training 
opportunities, and to treating applicants and 
employees without discrimination. We do not 
discriminate based on race, color, age, sex, 
sexual orientation, national origin, religion, 
language, or disabilities. Our policy is that no one 
at IBA should ever be subject to any kind of 
discrimination. 
This in the end leads to a feeling of 
connectedness which we define as Belonging. It 
is the feeling for an individual to be integral part 
of IBA, an organization where we all can feel at 
our best everywhere, every day. 
The B Corp framework chosen by IBA as 
reference for its sustainability approach includes 
measures on DEI, allowing IBA to track progress 
on that front”.

commitment to diversity in our corporate culture.

on the Group’s website, defines the core 
competencies the Board of Directors requires to

respecting the balance between outside, inside 
and other Directors laid down in the Articles of 
Association, the law, and the 2020 Corporate

ensures 
that

The key purpose of IBA’s remuneration 
philosophy is to ensure the Company is able to 
attract, retain and engage the executive talent it 
requires to deliver on its promises towards its 
various stakeholders – including its clients and 
patients, its shareholders, its employees, society 
in general and the planet –, whilst aligning to

The structure and levels of remuneration, in

Remuneration 
programs 
and

 
They 
appropriately 
balance 
external 
competitiveness with other organizations 
and internal equity, considering both the 
content of the position, and the personal 
competencies and effectiveness of the 
manager within IBA 
 
They are affordable, sustainable and cost 
efficient, avoiding excesses  
 
They reward performance aligned to the 
business strategy, considering short-term 
results and long-term focus  
 
They 
provide 
transparency 
and 
predictability, 
whilst 
offering 
enough 
flexibility to swiftly respond to changing 
business needs, if and when required  
 
The resulting remuneration is a fair balance 
from the point of view of all stakeholders, 
taking 
exceptional 
circumstances 
in 
consideration 
(fairness 
factor). 
In 
exceptional circumstances only, the non-

Total Remuneration components for 
Managing Directors and other Executive 
Management Team members 
For Managing Directors and other Executive 
Management 
Team 
members, 
total 
remuneration 
generally 
consists 
of 
fixed 
remuneration, variable remuneration and long-
term incentives. The weight of the different 
remuneration components, as part of total 
remuneration differs on an individual basis. In 
general terms, the weight of each component of 
remuneration accounts for a part of total 
remuneration that may be summarized as 
follows: 
Managing directors and other executive management team members 
 
REMUNERATION COMPONENT 
PART OF TOTAL REMUNERATION (WHEN OFFERED) 
Annual fixed remuneration 
Between 49% and 72%  
Annual variable remuneration (at target) 
Between 28% and 51%  
 
Annual Fixed Remuneration 
Annual fixed remuneration is a cash component 
of remuneration, defined in accordance with an 
individual’s position, as well as his or her 
competencies and experience in the position. 
Annual Variable Remuneration  
The annual variable remuneration program 
rewards 
performance 
against 
specified 
objectives, defined and formalized at the 
beginning of the performance period. Payout 
levels currently are targeted at between 15% and 
50% of annual fixed remuneration, depending on 
the position. Actual payout levels are subject to 
IBA’s performance. The maximum payout is set 
at 150% of target in case of exceptional 
performance, 
whilst 
performance 
below 
expectations results in a zero payout. The 
performance period is the fiscal year. 
For performance year 2023, performance is 
measured against 3 elements: Profit Before Tax, 
Order Intake and Sustainability for respectively 
33%, 33% and 34%.

towards

and 
exceeding 
the 
Company’s fiscal year objectives and specific 
milestones on IBA’s ESG goals. 
The Managing Directors are not present at the 
Board and Compensation Committee meetings 
where their performance and variable payout 
levels are discussed and decided. 
Profit Sharing Plan 
IBA’s multi-stakeholders approach includes a 
profit-sharing plan to materialize alignment 
between 
employees’ 
and 
shareholders’ 
interests. The payment of a dividend triggers a 
profit-sharing plan resulting in a common view of 
success. IBA’s commitment is to distribute the 
same amount to its employees as the total 
dividend paid to its shareholders. A number of 
Profit-Sharing Points is assigned to each IBA 
employee, proportionate to their responsibility 
level. Managing Directors and other Executive 
Management Team members participate to this 
plan alongside with employees. 
Agreements with the Managing Directors and 
members of the Executive Management Team 
do contain claw-back provisions in relation to any 
payments that would be made based on 
erroneous financial information. 
Long-term Incentives (LTI)  
IBA issues LTI usually under the form of a Stock 
Option Plan. The goal of this plan is to create 
further alignment between management and 
shareholders’ interests, allowing participants to 
benefit from the long-term value created. The 
value of LTI takes into consideration the potential 
gain 
vis-à-vis 
participants’ 
annual 
salary, 
provided the share price appreciates sufficiently. 
IBA has a policy to buy shares on the market to 
back-up LTI plan to neutralize the related 
dilution. These plans come alongside a share 
ownership guideline as described below 
A Stock Option Plan has been launched in 2021. 
This plan covers several years and there is 
currently no intention to open a new plan for the 
same beneficiaries before its vesting. Any 
proceeds earned under this plan will be handed 
to beneficiaries in the form of full shares until 
their Minimum Holding Requirement (MHR) as 
set here below is met.

for 
members 
of 
the 
Executive 
Management Team. The MHR shall have to be 
reached at the latest by 31st December 2026. 
The MHR can be built up in the manner which is 
deemed most appropriate by the individual on 
whom such minimum is imposed, including 
through the Long-Term Incentive plan described 
above. 
The MHR is applicable during the entire period 
of the contractual relationship with IBA, and 
during a three year period starting at the date the 
said contractual relationship terminates unless 
the termination of the contractual relationship is 
consecutive to the retirement or death of the 
concerned Executive. 
The Managing Directors are significant owners 
of the reference shareholder and comply with the 
MHR provision.

per other meeting attended. The fixed fees are 
on a half-day basis (assuming a half-day of 
preparation) and adjusted per half day if 
required. 
Non-Managing Directors do not receive any form 
of variable remuneration and no other form of 
fixed, equity-based or in-kind remuneration in 
the course of the year. 
At present, it is not anticipated that the policy will 
fundamentally change over the next two years. 
Both the level and structure of director 
remuneration are monitored and reviewed on an 
annual basis, which may result in an adjustment 
when deemed necessary or appropriate. 
Managing Directors do not receive specific 
director remuneration. The remuneration they 
receive for their direct or indirect role in the 
company includes compensation for their 
director responsibilities.

IBA – Annual Report 2023

Remuneration report Managing 
Directors 
and 
Executive 
Management Team in 2023 
This 
remuneration 
report 
outlines 
the 
implementation of the remuneration policy and 
will be annually submitted to the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting for an advisory vote 
Shareholder vote (section 7: 149, 3 °, of the 
BCAC). 
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting advisory vote on 
the previous remuneration report was 85,85 % in 
favor. No remarks were made to consider for the 
edition of this report. 
 
Context of remuneration during financial year 
2023  
In 2022 IBA achieved a net Profit before tax of -
0.430m€ combined with solid order intake for all  
our business lines and strong progress on the 
sustainability roadmap. These results translated 
into 90% of targeted payment of the variable 
portion of executive pay in 2023. 
 
Total Remuneration 
      In line with our Remuneration Policy, Managing 
Directors 
and 
Executive 
Managers 
compensation was composed in 2023 of a Base 
Salary and an Annual Variable Pay. 
The 
Managing 
Directors 
and 
Executive 
Managers who operate under a Management 
Company do not benefit from an IBA sponsored 
pension plan or of the other compensation 
elements described here above. 
On June 8 2022, the board of directors took the 
following resolution: 
 
The Board of Directors recommend that the 
members of the executive management team 
(MT), considered as such by the CEO and the 
Remuneration Committee from time to time, 
provide management consultancy services to 
the 
Company 
through 
an 
independently 
organized management company, and not 
through an employment relationship.

the

through 
an

through an employment relationship. The Board 
believes, together with the Belgian regulator, 
that the framework allowing for the executive 
management to perform its duties i.e. under 
Principles 2.19, 2.20, 20.21, and 2.22 of the 
Belgian Code of Corporate Governance (2020) 
in collegial uniformity and with the greatest 
impact, is best served through a management 
company 
structure 
whereby 
the 
“intuitu 
personae” 
relationship 
remains 
the 
most 
important asset”. 
 
On 29 September 2023, the contract between 
IBA and Research Management Systems SRL 
was ended in a mutual agreement, and a new 
contract with Exoplanets Research SRL was 
concluded for the rendering of Yves Jongen’s 
consulting services. 
 
Variable Pay – short term incentives 
Plan Criteria 
 
The variable compensation paid in 2023 
relates to 2022 performance year. The plan 
was based on business results vs pre-
defined goals which were measured for 33% 
against Profit Before Tax (PBT),  for 33% 
against Order Intake and for 34% on 
Sustainability. 
 
The choice of these performance criteria 
contributes to the long term development of 
the company, being a mix of current financial 
performance (backlog conversion), new 
business 
(backlog 
creation) 
and 
stakeholders impact (sustainability). 
 
In order to protect its competitive 
position, IBA does not disclose targets. 
 
Each criteria is assessed separately 
against 
pre-approved 
targets.

A 
performance score is assigned to each

out as described in the following table: 
 
Actual Pay-Out 
 
At the group level, the Order Intake portion and 
the PBT portion did not generate any payment, 
and a B-Corp interim assessment by an 
independent body led to a payment of 150. This 
resulted in a final pay-out of 51%. 
The variable pay is capped at 150% of target 
payment. There was no need to apply this cap 
for performance year 2023.

achieve its strategic mission of protecting,

detailed are fully part of its business model and 
drives 
IBA’s 
objectives, 
strategies, 
and 
organization. For this reason, the Company has 
worked to create a Code of Business Conduct 
and updates it on a regular basis, the most 
recent update being 2021. 
This Code defines the fundamental principles of 
business conduct ( a total of 11 principles are 
described) and provides guidance for the 
Group’s employees and co-contracting parties 
on such matters as business partnerships, 
conflicts of interest, fair competition, protection 
of intellectual property, data privacy and 
confidentiality, anti-bribery and corruption, and 
protection of the universal human rights, of the 
environment, health, and safety. 
A new version of this Code was approved by the 
Board of directors on December 18, 2020 and 
slightly updated in 2021. This new version 
underlines the importance of and details specific 
actions taken against corruption and bribery as 
well as for the active protection of Human Rights. 
The Code of Business Conduct is available on 
the 
Company’s 
website 
www.iba-
worldwide.com, on the following https://www.iba-
worldwide.com/content/code-conduct 
This Code is the object of a specific training with 
a quiz with a required 80% succes rate for 
passing, mandatory for all IBA employees, 
trainees, interim personnel and a selection of 
consultants. The purpose of this training is to 
remind employees of the fundamental principles 
contained in the Code, which we apply every day 
at IBA throughout all businesses and across the 
globe. It also aims at informing employees of the 
different options to report non-compliance with 
the Code. In December 2021, a whistleblower 
platform in line with European and international 
standards was activated on the Company’s 
website. The platform thus provides IBA’s 
stakeholders with the possibility to anonimously 
report alleged violations of the Code of Business 
Conduct in addition to the existing Company 
channels.

Conduct in addition to the existing Company 
channels. Complaints are managed by the 
Compliance Officer who remains the central 
point of contact with the responsibility to monitor 
compliance and follow up on reported incidents 
of non-compliance. All complaints concerned 
either potential conflicts of interests (Principle 1 
of the Code of Business Conduct) or alleged 
(attempts) of corruption (Principle 10 of the Code 
of Business Conduct). The countries involved 
were mainly China and Russia. No conclusive 
evidence was found for any of the alleged 
violations. The Compliance Officer reports on 
the Code of Business Conduct (training, 
monitoring, investigations, conflict of interest 
notifications and suggestions for improvement) 
to the Company’s Audit Committee. 
In 2023, over 90% of IBA’s employees passed 
the training on the Code of Business Conduct 
(with a score of more than 80%). 
IBA has also implemented a set of ethical 
principles of doing business with Suppliers. All 
suppliers of goods and services of IBA are 
required to subscribe to these principles. The 
Suppliers Code is attached to all contract 
templates and final contracts signed by IBA’s 
suppliers. Annual ad hoc audits are carried out 
to monitor compliance with the Suppliers Code. 
Policy and Targets 
The Code of Business Conduct sets out the 
principles of IBA’s social and staff-related 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policy. It is, 
among others, based on the International Labor

IBA’s employees are the most valuable

IBA – Annual Report 2023 
81. IBA 
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work. 
IBA’s employees are the most valuable 
resources of the Company and are essential to 
its success. Diversity is fundamental to IBA’s 
culture and the uniqueness of individuals and the 
various perspectives and talents they bring are 
recognized and valued. The Company promotes 
diversity within our workforce and an inclusive 
environment that helps each and every one of us 
to fully contribute to its success. 
IBA is committed to provide equal employment 
opportunities 
and 
treating 
applicants 
and 
employees 
without 
discrimination. 
No 
discrimination is based on race, color, age, sex 
(including pregnancy, sexual orientation, or 
gender 
identity), 
national 
origin, 
religion, 
language, veteran status, genetic information 
(including family medical history), and physical 
or mental disability. The Company’s DEI policy is 
that no one at IBA should ever be subject to any 
kind of discrimination. The membership or non-
membership of a trade union is also free. 
IBA commits itself to a positive, productive, and 
safe work environment that is free from violence, 
threats, harassment, intimidation, mental or 
physical coercion, and other disruptive behavior. 
The Company does not permit any form of 
violence, whether physical, verbal, or mental; all 
threats of violence are considered serious. IBA 
is also committed to a workplace free of 
harassment. Social rights, as an integral part of 
human rights, are actively protected by the 
Company. 
IBA also ensures the highest standards of safety 
for all employees. IBA’s target, as defined in the 
Code of Business Conduct, is “No Harm” to our 
people. As an example, the Code of Business 
Conduct clearly states that all employees are 
empowered to stop any activity which they judge 
hazardous and goes against the “No Harm” 
principle. The Code also defines working times 
that cannot be exceeded, even if local rules and 
regulations allow for such excess. Other internal 
policies ensure a high level of safety for all 
employees (e.g.: the “Working at Height Policy”, 
the “PPE Matrix Policy”, the “Global Radiation 
Safety Policy”, the “LOTO Policy”, the “Electrical 
Policy”,…).

updating of these policies are discussed in the 
Committee for Protection and Prevention at 
Work. 
Beyond mere compliance with the law, IBA 
conducts its business in accordance with the 
highest standards of honesty and integrity. 
In addition to the Code of Business Conduct, 
IBA’s Data Handling Policy explains how IBA 
complies with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) to protect the Personal Data 
of 
clients, 
suppliers, 
patients, 
investors, 
contractors, staff members, and anyone else IBA 
is doing business with. 
IBA supports local businesses, strengthening 
communities, 
and 
reducing 
emissions 
associated with transporting goods. IBA also 
recognizes 
that 
establishing 
long-term 
relationships with significant suppliers is an 
indicator of steadiness and provides revenue 
and job stability for the supplier and their 
employees. IBA hires employees in majority in-
country, creating jobs and providing wages to 
residents in the local area, boosting the local 
economy. IBA facilities themselves are built, 
maintained, and controlled in respect of local 
regulations, have waste recycling in place, and 
no toxic air or water emissions that could affect 
local communities. 
Non-financial Indicators and Results 
A system of formal reporting is described in the 
Code of Business Conduct and encourages the 
denunciation 
of 
infringing 
practices 
(e.g.: 
discrimination, 
harassment, 
coercion, 
etc.) 
through 
both 
internal 
channels 
and 
a 
whistleblower platform. When such notification is 
made to IBA, IBA promptly takes appropriate 
measuresto bring the situation back into 
conformity with the Code and the Company’s 
policies, and to prevent a recurrence of such a 
situation. 
The age distribution within the IBA Group is quite 
wide, ranging from 20 to over 60, indicating a fair 
and balanced value between employees.

Environmental Matters 
Policy and Targets 
IBA promotes a sustainable entrepreneurial 
business model that serves society while striving 
to respect the limits of our planet, and, in order 
to do so, develops and introduces technologies 
with less or low environmental impact and 
processes, whether: 
 
in its business activities, by working to help 
create a society with sound material cycles, 
by supporting efforts to better understand 
environmental issues. 
 
by establishing environmental management 
processes 
in 
its 
factories, 
seeking 
continuous 
improvement 
in 
its 
environmental management; 
 
by 
supporting 
communication 
and 
cooperation 
regarding 
environmental 
protection worldwide; 
 
by supporting as much as possible any 
personal or collective initiative that would 
help reduce the impact of the Company’s 
activities on the environment. 
IBA is attentive to the impact of its activities, 
products, and services on the environment and 
takes measures to decrease its ecological 
footprint, including initiatives to: 
 
consume 
less 
energy 
and 
resources 
(including promoting circular economy and 
sustainable transport) through ecodesign 
practices; 
 
reduce emissions (in particular greenhouse 
gas); 
 
protect surrounding nature (substance of 
concern 
management, 
ground 
and 
groundwater contamination, and biodiversity 
protection surrounding our facilities); and  
 
better manage waste (minimization and 
recycling). 
Within IBA, every employee is expected to 
perform 
his/her 
job 
with 
environmental 
awareness and to apply the principles of 
prevention, precaution and rectification at 
source. 
Through its Code of Conduct for Suppliers, the 
Company further encourages its major suppliers 
to share its commitment to the environment and 
to reduce the environmental impact of their 
designs, manufacturing processes, waste, and 
emissions.

corrupt practices are strictly against IBA’s policy, 
even if refusing to make such payment would

As such, IBA, including its employees and 
representatives, must not accept, neither 
directly, nor through any family member or 
anyone else, gifts or favours of any kind from a 
business partner, or offer the same to the latter, 
or to any public official, except if they are 
courtesy gifts, considered as modest in value 
and to the extent that the time and place is 
appropriate. 
In any case, such favours are prohibited if they 
may affect or even appear to affect the integrity 
or independence of the business partner, the 
public official, IBA, or its employees. The duty of 
integrity and trust are of primary importance 
within the Company and any illegal or unethical 
act would not be tolerated. 
Through its Code of Conduct for Suppliers, the 
Company moreover targets to work with third 
parties that share its commitment to ethics and 
that share its values of business integrity. 
Hence, the target is to achieve the objective of 
no IBA’s third-party providers, customers, and 
partners involved in any corrupt practices. 
Non-financial Indicators and Results 
A two-phase plan is being implemented to 
increase awareness and monitoring targets. The 
first phase took place in 2020, with an in-depth 
evaluation of IBA’s practices, the conduction of 
a fraud risk assessment, and an update of a 
number of internal processes. This evaluation 
focused on key risk areas such as corruption, 
asset misappropriation, financial statement 
fraud, cyberfraud of theft of data, and contract 
and procurement fraud. As a second phase, 
informal training of employees is taking place on

above, in the dedicated Section “Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties faced by the Company” 
(Sections 3:6, §1, 1° to 3° and 3:32, §1, 1° to 3°, 
of the BCAC).In order to limit its bribery and 
corruption risk, IBA is continuously identifying 
the specific risks it could be exposed to by (i) 
strictly analyzing third-party providers’ (with 
whom we are working) reputation including anti-
money laundering due diligence, (ii) examining 
transactions with governments or government 
institutions and representatives, (iii) creating 
new legal entities overseas with due diligence, 
and 
(iv) 
educating 
employees 
through 
communications and proper training. 
Protection and Respect of Human 
Rights 
Policy and Targets 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
defines human rights as rights inherent to all 
human 
beings, 
regardless 
of 
race, 
sex, 
nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any 
other status. Human rights include the right to life 
and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, 
freedom of opinion and expression, the right to 
work and education, and many more. Everyone 
is entitled to these rights, without discrimination. 
Respect of Human Rights is essential to ensure 
a sustainable working environment for everyone.

It is also essential to act for a better world and it 
is a part of how the Company wants to behave 
and the values we want to be known for. To that 
extent, IBA complies with all applicable local, 
national, and international laws and regulations 
dealing with or impacting Human Rights. The 
relevant international sources we refer to are the 
International Bill of Human Rights, UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, and 
the principles set out in the International Labor 
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.

and regulations when it comes to – notably but 
not limited to - working time, travel time, and time 
recovery are respected. 
IBA also prohibits the employment of children. 
Every child has the right not to perform work that 
is mentally, physically, socially, or morally 
harmful or that interferes with his/her schooling. 
IBA vets the age of all applicants prior to their 
employment. We believe corporate compliance 
is also demonstrated through  elements, 
including the Company’s 2021 B Corp (“Benefit 
Corporation") certification . 
Equal employment opportunities are offered to 
all IBA employees. No discrimination is made on 
any basis whatsoever. Decisions relating to 
employment are solely based on the skills, 
abilities, and performance of the employee. 
Every IBA employee has the right to join a trade 
union or any other organization. As per its “Equal 
opportunity” principle, no one at IBA should ever 
be subject to any kind of discrimination because 
of accession to or creation of a trade union nor 
because of the employee’s choice not to join or 
create such group. 
The right to a healthy and sustainable 
environment is the cornerstone between Human 
Rights 
and 
their 
interaction 
with 
the 
environment. It includes the environment’s 
impact on many rights such as the right to life, 
health, 
food, 
water, 
sanitation, 
property, 
housing, private life, culture, development, and 
non- discrimination. IBA is aware of the 
importance of this right as our generation faces 
a serious environmental crisis and associated 
impact on Human Rights. The environment (“the 
Planet”) is therefore included as one of the five 
stakeholders of IBA and receives central 
attention in the day-to-day work within the 
Company. 
Compliance with Human Rights is not only 
required by IBA and its employees, but also from 
its customers and suppliers.

Company. 
Compliance with Human Rights is not only 
required by IBA and its employees, but also from 
its customers and suppliers. Through its Code of 
Conduct for Suppliers, the Company ensures to 
work with third parties that share its commitment 
to Human Rights and that do not violate the 
Human 
Rights 
of 
their 
employees. 
All 
consultants and other parties acting on behalf of 
IBA are also expected to fully respect the Human 
Rights of their employees, suppliers, and 
customers. Ad hoc audits of selected suppliers 
are carried out every year. 
Non-financial Indicators and Results 
As described hereabove, system of formal 
reporting 
(whistleblower 
platform) 
is 
also 
described in the Code of Business Conduct and 
encourages the denunciation of practices that 
would be contrary to IBA’s Human Rights policy. 
In the event of a denunciation to the IBA, the 
latter will promptly take appropriate measures: i) 
to bring the situation back into conformity with 
human rights, and ii) to prevent the repetition of 
such a violation. 
IBA is continuously assessing its suppliers to 
ensure that their activities do not contribute to 
the infringement of Human Rights. This 
assessment is dependent on the nature of the 
services that are required from the supplier and 
on the geographical location of this supplier. 
By 2023, all new IBA suppliers have recognized 
and signed the Supplier Code of Conduct. 
No incident with respect to Human Rights 
relating to the IBA’s activities or decisions were 
noticed in 2023. 
A large majority of IBA’s facilities are accessible 
to persons with reduced mobility. As an example, 
the four main buildings in Louvain-la-Neuve are 
fully adapted for such people. If necessary, a 
constructive discussion is held with the person 
with reduced mobility in order to guarantee him 
or her a workspace where he or she can move 
around as independently as possible.

sustainable and inclusive economy and society. 
The B Corp certification has been awarded to 
IBA by B Lab, the non-profit organization behind 
the B Corp movement worldwide. The rigorous 
assessment of the company's business model 
and operations demonstrates that IBA meets 
some 
of 
the 
highest 
environmental, 
transparency 
and 
social 
responsibility 
standards. This prestigious label, internationally 
recognized as one of the most comprehensive 
and demanding in its field, attests to IBA's 
effective commitment to objectives that are 
aimed at both the collective interest and 
shareholder 
profit. 
The 
performance 
is 
particularly remarkable for an international 
industrial company of IBA's size. 
The B Corp certification process covered all of 
IBA's activities and assessed five main areas of 
impact: 
governance, 
workers, 
community, 
environment and customers. The company was 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
socially 
and 
environmentally responsible practices in the 
areas of energy, health, welfare, compensation, 
diversity, transparency and more. At the end of 
2023, IBA had a proforma score of 106+pts, 26 
points higher than the reference score of 80, 
required for certification. In accordance with B 
Lab requirements, IBA has also modified its 
articles of Association to formally integrate its 
commitment to consider the consequences of its 
activities and the interests of all stakeholders 
(patients, shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers, the community, the planet, etc.) in 
social, 
economic, 
legal, 
societal 
and 
environmental areas. 
The B Corp certification was an important but 
humble first step; IBA is becoming an 
inspirational company for others, which brings 
responsibility to us and inspiration to others. 
Inspired by the findings along the B Corp 
certification process, we mapped our strengths 
and weaknesses as a company.

identified 4 strategic sustainability streams to 
work on,with a third of company targets linked to 
related B Corp objectives. 
SUSTAINABILITY PROGRESS 
 
The 4 streams identified are a target to support 
our 2024 B Corp recertification, but even more a 
guidance book to build our sustainability journey. 
From this, the 2023 variable targets for 
Management and Opt-Ins are as follows: 33% 
Order Intake, 33% PBT vs budget, and 34% 
sustainability based on B Corp score. 
 
The stream ‘low carbon, low waste products’ 
addresses the understanding and reduction of 
the CO2 and waste impact of our products 
across their life cycles and value chains. 
Ecodesign workgroup is in place, with 220 
people trained and challenges ongoing to 
promote the 8 established IBA eco-design rules. 
Based on life cycle analysis of main products 
and activities, the IBA Group carbon footprint 
has been assessed and allocated to the relevant 
BU activities and products. Dialogue is engaged 
with BU’s on sustainability in product extended

farming projects (Soil Capital). A green mobility 
project is in place, based on employee survey, in 
view of defining a lower impact, yet attractive, 
mobility policy for our commuting employees. 
The stream ‘diverse, equitable and inclusive

as a major contributor to belonging. A number of 
collective intelligence initiatives are in place such 
a

Today, IBA revenues do not fall within scope,

non-financial reporting tool on a voluntary basis, 
but which could become part of the mandatory 
reporting obligations in the future. For 2023, no 
changes are expected. However, as of reporting 
year 2024 the corporate sustainability reporting 
directive will become effective with subsequent 
reporting obligations, but probably based on GRI 
standards. The corporate sustainability due 
diligence duties are still in draft form but may 
come into effect as of 2025. IBA is well prepared 
for 
this 
evolution 
in 
sustainability/finance 
reporting. 
Taxonomy  
In order to achieve the EU's climate and energy 
objectives for 2030 and to meet the objectives of 
the European Green Deal, the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 was established to 
assess the sustainability of economic activities 
taking into account the different circumstances 
and obligations of the different economic actors. 
It sets out six environmental objectives: 
- 
Mitigation of climate change 
- 
Adaptation to climate change 
- 
Sustainable use and protection of water 
and marine resources 
- 
Transition to a circular economy 
- 
Pollution prevention and control 
- 
Protection and restoration of 
biodiversity and ecosystems 
Activities covered by the taxonomy are referred 
to as taxonomy-eligible activities. For these 
activities, the delegated acts that complete the 
taxonomy define performance criteria for the 
environmental objectives, as well as minimum 
safeguards for the protection of human rights 
and labor law. An activity is considered  
taxonomy-aligned if it makes a substantial 
contribution to one or more objectives, without 
significantly undermining the other objectives, 
and if it also complies with the defined minimum 
safeguards. 
Different means may be required for an activity 
to make a substantial contribution to each 
objective. 
The 
EU 
Taxonomy 
Regulation 
requires the disclosure of the percentage of 
turnover,

expenditure

For these 
activities, the delegated acts that complete the 
taxonomy define performance criteria for the 
environmental objectives, as well as minimum 
safeguards for the protection of human rights 
and labor law. An activity is considered  
taxonomy-aligned if it makes a substantial 
contribution to one or more objectives, without 
significantly undermining the other objectives, 
and if it also complies with the defined minimum 
safeguards. 
Different means may be required for an activity 
to make a substantial contribution to each 
objective.

Taxonomy eligibility and alignment 
A cross-functional taxonomy working group has 
analysed IBA’s activities based on NACE code 
(Nomenclature of Economic Activities) to identify 
candidate activities and related financial data 
related to taxonomy-eligible turnover, CapEx 
and OpEx. 
Turnover 
The EU Taxonomy currently identifies eligible 
activities among seven different sectors, as 
making a substantial contribution to any of the 
six environmental objectives. IBA core activities 
are classified under NACE C26.6 (26600) 
Manufacture of irradiation, electromedical and 
electrotherapeutic equipment9). No portion of 
IBA turnover is currently attributable to the 
economic activities covered by the current 
taxonomy. 
Capital expenditure (CapEx) 
In 2023, IBA taxonomy-eligible capital 
expenditure relates to: 
 
installation of bike shelter infrastructures 
(taxonomy category 6.15) 
 
installation of charging stations for electrical 
vehicles (taxonomy category 7.4) 
 
long term lease of hybrid (PHEV) and electric 
vehicles (EV) (taxonomy category 6.5) 
 
installation of photovoltaic renewable energy 
production means (taxonomy category 7.6) 
 
- upgrade of energy efficient equipments 
(taxonomy category 7.3) 
 
In analysis of these taxonomy-eligible activities, 
IBA identifies the following as taxonomy-
aligned: 
 
installation of bike shelter infrastructures 
(taxonomy category 6.15) 
 
installation of charging stations for electrical 
vehicles (taxonomy category 7.4) 
 
installation of photovoltaic renewable energy 
production means (taxonomy category 7.6)

_all.html 
 
upgrade of energy efficient equipments 
(taxonomy category 7.3) 
When it comes to long term lease of hybrid 
(PHEV) and electrical vehicles (EV), IBA 
currently has limited insight into the full life cycle 
of the said vehicles (materials production and 
recyclability, consumables (such tires), waste 
management) and acknowledges that more 
information is needed to ensure that the 
technical screening criteria are met. Hence, for 
these taxonomy-eligible activities, IBA currently 
deems them to be not taxonomy-aligned.

For the year ended on December 31, 2023, the 
Group 
gross 
margin 
(31.4%) 
worsened 
compared to 2022 (35.1%) following inflation 
and lower overhead absorption. The previous 
year performance was also positively impacted 
by indemnities related to the Rutherford’s 
bankruptcy. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Group operating 
expenses were EUR 128.0 million, a 10.6%% 
increase from 2022 (2022: EUR 115.7 million). 
Despite efficient control of overhead costs, 
careful spending and IBA’s cost control 
measures, the increase is to be observed on all 
three types of expenses and reflects the 
conditions of the general macro-economic 
environment, however the increase is mainly to 
be seen on Research and Development which 
went up by 14.5%; this demonstrates the 
strategic efforts that IBA is making on both 
operating segments to maintain its technological 
leadership in all business lines. 
Recurring operating profits before interest and 
taxes (REBIT10) decreased from a gain of EUR 
11.1 million in 2022 to a gain of EUR 6.4million, 
reflecting the current inflation and factors related 
to the current macro-economic environment, 
coupled with one off indemnities related to the 
Rutherford’s bankruptcy in 2022. 
For the year-ended December 31, 2023, the 
other operating result (profit) was EUR -1.2 
million (2022: EUR -6.1 million) ; it mainly 
includes some reorganisation expenses for EUR 
2.5 million and the costs incurred for the Stock 
Option plan for EUR 1.0 million, offset by a net 
gain on the contribution in kind of the IP to the 
group’s new Joint Venture Pantera for EUR 2.2 
million (net of other investors interests). The 
reorganization expenses mostly relate to the 
discontinuation of the Dynamitron line of 
business in the US. This was a non-major 
business for IBA and Management decided to re-
focus the efforts on developing its other 
sterilization devices. 
For the year-ended on December 31, 2023, the 
financial result (expenses) was EUR -5.2million 
(2022: EUR -5.4 million expenses).

For the year-ended on December 31, 2023, the 
financial result (expenses) was EUR -5.2million 
(2022: EUR -5.4 million expenses). In 2023, 
despite decreasing interests payments and 
improved foreign currency impacts (realised and 
un-realised gains and losses as well as change 
in fair value of derivatives), the group was 
strongly impacted by the effects of hyperinflation 
in Argentina. 
As at December 31, 2023, the Group recognises 
a tax expense for an amount of EUR -8.8 million 
representing -2792.1% of the profit before tax. 
The tax charge results from margin recognised 
in some countries with a relatively high tax rate 
as well as a partial reversal of the deferred tax 
assets. 
As a result of the above effects, IBA reported a 
net loss of EUR -9.1 million down from a gain of 
EUR 6.1 million in the prior year.

The Group’s non-current assets amount to EUR 
145.5 million, increased by EUR 22.1 million 
during the 2023 financial year, essentially due to 
the following effects: 
 
An increase of the goodwill and intangible

additional development costs on internally

of the costs incurred by IBA in the

Short-term provisions amount to EUR 8.8

1.1 million. The total provisions (short-term 
and long-term) remained stable despite the 
following main changes:  
 
An increase of the warranty provisions for 
EUR 0.6 million 
 
A decrease of the other provision (onerous 
contract mainly) for EUR -1.1 million following 
the revision of costs and synergies to be 
reached 
Other short-term payables at the end of 2023 
amount to EUR 68.9 million which represents a 
decrease of EUR -6.7 million compared to 2022. 
This decrease is mainly explained by the 
decrease of non-trade payables by EUR -6.4 
million, the decrease of other current liabilies for 
EUR -3.8 million which includes the release of 
the refund liability of EUR -5.0 million. The 
performance bond with CGNTT was recognised  
as a refund liability until the uncertainty 
associated with the variable consideration is 
resolved, and it was agreed in December 2023 
to cancel completely the performance bond.

million, and by the increase of deferred income 
for EUR 2.1 million 
 The income tax payable increase by EUR 2.1 
million. 
Trade payables have increased by EUR 11.0 
million which reflects the increase orders on 
stock and inventories. 
The Group's cash and cash equivalents 
presented in the cash-flow statement decreased 
by EUR -49.1 million in 2023, mainly due to: 
 
a negative operating cash-flow of EUR -19.8 
million mainly related to the change of 
working capital for EUR -16.9 million and the 
net loss of EUR -9.1 million; 
 
Negative financing cash-flow of EUR -14.4

related 
to 
the

of 
borrowings and lease liabilities for EUR -7.5 
million (mainly lease liabilities), the dividend 
paid for EUR -6.1 million and; 
 
 Negative investing cash-flow of EUR -13.3

INCOME STATEMENT 
In 2023, IBA SA reported a profit of EUR 13.8 
million compared to a loss of EUR 14.5 million in 
2022, representing an improvement of EUR 28.4 
million, as described in the following paragraphs. 
Operating income (excluding other extraordinary 
income) increased substantially year-on-year, 
from EUR 346.1 million in 2022 to EUR 449.4 
million in 2023, predominantly due to an 
increased level of activity. 
The operating profit amounted to EUR 17.3 
million in 2023 against a loss of EUR -6.6 million 
in 2022, a net increase of EUR 23.9 million. This 
is again driven by a higher activity level, hence 
higher gross margin, but also by higher 
investments by the company to remain ready for 
the future, which partially offsets the postive 
trend in the margin.

INCOME STATEMENT 
In 2023, IBA SA reported a profit of EUR 13.8 
million compared to a loss of EUR 14.5 million in 
2022, representing an improvement of EUR 28.4 
million, as described in the following paragraphs. 
Operating income (excluding other extraordinary 
income) increased substantially year-on-year, 
from EUR 346.1 million in 2022 to EUR 449.4 
million in 2023, predominantly due to an 
increased level of activity. 
The operating profit amounted to EUR 17.3 
million in 2023 against a loss of EUR -6.6 million 
in 2022, a net increase of EUR 23.9 million. This 
is again driven by a higher activity level, hence 
higher gross margin, but also by higher 
investments by the company to remain ready for 
the future, which partially offsets the postive 
trend in the margin. 
Operating expenses increased by EUR 81.6 
million in 2023 to EUR 434.3 million. The 
operating expenses among others include the 
cost of goods and services sold, which increased 
alongside the operating income. Other important 
increases can be found in the salaries and 
remuneration which is mainly driven by the index 
adjustment beginning of the year. 
The R&D expenditure of EUR 55.7 million in 
2023 (EUR 46.7 million in 2022) is capitalized. 
Development expenditure up to and including 
2022 was capitalized and depreciated over three 
years, 
while 
research 
expenses 
were 
depreciated immediately in the year of the 
expenditure. 
For 
the 
expenditure 
on 
Development (EUR 51.8 million), as from 2023 
onwards, depreciation is done pro rate temporis 
on a monthly basis, respectively over 36 months, 
starting the month following the expenditure. For 
Research (EUR 3.9 million) expenditure is 
depreciated within the year. 
IBA presented a financial profit of EUR 0.6 
million compared to a loss of EUR -7.2 million in 
2022. The profit of 2023 is mostly the result of a 
dividend received from the Chinese subsidiary 
(amounting to EUR 13.8 million); the other 
categories of cost include interest expenses, 
foreign exchange impacts, and bank charges. 
The operational perspectives of IBA SA remain 
positive. 
At the end of 2023, the Company had ten 
branches, in the following locations: Prague, 
Czech Republic; Orsay, France; Krakow,

For 
Research (EUR 3.9 million) expenditure is 
depreciated within the year. 
IBA presented a financial profit of EUR 0.6 
million compared to a loss of EUR -7.2 million in 
2022. The profit of 2023 is mostly the result of a 
dividend received from the Chinese subsidiary 
(amounting to EUR 13.8 million); the other 
categories of cost include interest expenses, 
foreign exchange impacts, and bank charges. 
The operational perspectives of IBA SA remain 
positive. 
At the end of 2023, the Company had ten 
branches, in the following locations: Prague, 
Czech Republic; Orsay, France; Krakow,

Dublin, Ireland.. The South Korean branch will 
be dissolved in 2024. The branches were 
established as part of the Company’s Proton 
Therapy business (section 3:6, §1, 5°, of the 
BCAC). 
The 2023 profit amounts to EUR 13.8 million, the 
profit carried forward from the previous years is 
EUR 119.0 million, making a total profit for 
appropriation of EUR 132.8 million. 
An unavailable reserve for the own shares needs 
to be recognised, impact of EUR 12.7 million – 
this increased the Retained Earnings to the 
amount mentioned above with EUR 4.5 million 
(share price decreased compared to end of 
2022). 
IBA’s Board of Directors proposes to the General 
Assembly to distribute a dividend of EUR 5.0 
million, and to carry forward the remaining 
amount (EUR 132.6 million) to the next financial 
year.
BALANCE SHEET 
Intangible Assets 
Investments in intangible assets 
Intangible assets amounted to EUR 69.0 million 
per December 31, 2023 compared to EUR 46.4 
million per December 31, 2022. These intangible 
assets relate mainly to: 
• 
Research and Development costs for EUR 
57.7 million. The net amount is higher 
because of the change in Depreciation (cf. 
next paragraph) and the increased spend 
compared to 2022. 
• 
Intangible assets under construction for a 
net worth of EUR 9.0 million which includes 
development costs related to Product 
Lifecycle Management and the EU Medical 
Device Regulation. 
In accordance with the Royal Decree of 
December 15, 2015, research costs have been 
capitalized and amortized over the year since 
January 1, 2016. Development costs in 2023 
were, as mentioned before, as from 2023 
onwards depreciated monthly on a pro rata 
temporis basis (36 months). For research costs 
all expenditure was depreciated within the year.

Investments in tangible assets 
Tangible fixed assets represent EUR 29.7 million 
as of December 31, 2023. The increase of EUR 
1.4 million year-on-year is mainly related to 
investments for a total amount of EUR 4.3 
million, 
among 
others 
in 
building-related 
expenditure (such as solar panels), installations 
and IT equipment (such as laptops), offset by 
EUR -2.8 million of depreciation of existing and 
newly acquired assets in operation. 
Financial fixed assets 
Financial fixed assets amount to EUR 160.4 
million in 2023 compared to EUR 139.0 million in 
2022, a net increase of EUR 21.4 million. This 
increase is mainly the result of the following 
events: a subsequent capital increase in the 
Joint Venture with SCK-CEN, PanTera NV, for 
an amount of EUR 20.4 million and a convertible 
loan with the same JV for EUR 1.0 million. 
Besides these transactions, IBA wrote off the 
11.4% (USD 2 million, EUR 1.8 million) stake in 
HIL Applied Medical Ltd, an Israelian developer 
of laser-based proton therapy systems. And IBA 
invested a further EUR 1.6 million in Invest BW, 
a regional venture capital partner that is 
providing financing and support to entrepreneurs 
in Walloon Brabant (cf. paragraph 5.5). 
The participations in affiliated companies (EUR 
129.4 million), contain among others the 
participation in the affilated company IBA 
Russia. In paragraph 2.1 we have analyzed the 
impact of the EU sanctions on the control of IBA 
SA on its Russian subsidiary, and the indicators 
of asset impairment the conflict may raise. 
Besides the investments in affiliated companies, 
IBA SA also holds equity investments in some 
companies: 
 
A 39.8% (EUR 6.1 million) stake in NHa SA, a 
French company active in the development of 
a carbon therapy treatment system 
 
A 33% stake in Cyclhad, a French company 
active in treatment of patients using Proton 
Therapy.

million at end of 2023, a small decrease when 
compared to the end of 2022 (EUR 21.4 million). 
The decrease of EUR -0.3 million is mainly due 
to a decrease of miscellaneous long-term 
receivables for an amount of EUR -1.2 million, 
which includes a long-term receivable on a 
Proton Therapy Centre in Italy as well as the 
long-term portion of a commercial receivable on 
a Chinese customer, compensated by a higher

progress increased by EUR 30.1 million. 
Contracts in progress decreased from EUR 66.7 
million to EUR 58.5 million. The overall increase 
of the inventories is the result of the significant 
ramp-up of activities after the two covid-years 
2020 and 2021, which is also visible in the 
operating income. 
Since 2016, the amounts of contracts in progress 
and down-payments received on such contracts 
are shown as a net position at the level of each 
project whereby the ones with a down-payment 
that is lower than the contract in progress value 
are shown as a net ‘contract in progress’ position

Short-term receivables 
Short-term receivables decreased with EUR -
48.5 million from EUR 181.6 million in 2022 to 
EUR 133.1 million in 2023. This decrease is on 
the one side driven by a decrease of the Trade 
Accounts Receivable section, decrease of EUR 
-32.0 million, in which predominantly the 
intercompany receivables decreased (EUR -
21.8 million). 
The other receivables, on the other side, 
amounting to EUR 13.5 million, decreased with 
EUR -16.5 million a/o because of the release of 
a 7.3 million payment from the Russian 
subsidiary that had temporarily been blocked by 
the Belgian authorities as part of a review 
measure 
under 
the 
current 
embargo 
environment and the write-off of a EUR 3.3

Cash investments amounted to EUR 12.7 million

or 
specific 
transactions, committed or to come, in gross

General financial risk management policy 
focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and attempts to minimize potential 
negative effects on financial results. IBA uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to certain risks. 
Financial risk management is carried out by a 
central treasury department (Group Treasury). 
Rules are in place which establish written 
principles for the management of financial risks 
as well as written rules covering specific areas, 
such as currency risk, the use of derivative and 
non-derivative financial instruments and the 
investment of excess liquidity. The Group's 
Treasury identifies, assesses and covers 
financial risks in close cooperation with the 
Company. 
More details on the management of financial 
risks are available in the chapter “FINANCIAL 
RISKS (ARTICLES 3: 6, §1, 8 ° AND 3:32, §1, 
5°, OF THE BCAC)” of the consolidated financial 
statements, see page 162. 
Significants acquisitions and divestments in 
2023 
In Febrary 2023, the group acquired Fluidomica 
LD.A. This entity produces Target Solutions for 
Medical Radioisopes Market. 
IBA also acquired a minority stake in Invest.BW 
S.A, a venture capital partner supporting the 
economic development in the Walloon Region. 
In 2023, Management has also decided to re-
focus the efforts of the Industrial business on the 
Rhodotron, as a result, the group closed the 
legacy Dynamitron business. 
 
General outlook for 2024  
IBA delivered a solid performance in the second 
half of 2023, resulting in a positive REBIT margin 
for the full year, as expected. Looking ahead, the 
Group 
anticipates 
continued 
positive 
development in revenues and margins across all 
business units. Targeted investment for the 
future growth of the business will continue with a 
focus 
on 
investment 
into 
sustainability,

IBA also acquired a minority stake in Invest.BW 
S.A, a venture capital partner supporting the 
economic development in the Walloon Region. 
In 2023, Management has also decided to re-
focus the efforts of the Industrial business on the 
Rhodotron, as a result, the group closed the 
legacy Dynamitron business. 
 
General outlook for 2024  
IBA delivered a solid performance in the second 
half of 2023, resulting in a positive REBIT margin 
for the full year, as expected. Looking ahead, the 
Group 
anticipates 
continued 
positive 
development in revenues and margins across all 
business units. Targeted investment for the 
future growth of the business will continue with a 
focus 
on 
investment 
into 
sustainability, 
digitalization and innovation. IBA’s supply chain 
remains 
under 
control, 
with 
inflationary 
pressures closely monitored. The balance sheet 
remains strong, providing the Group with 
significant flexibility for both organic and 
inorganic growth. 
IBA reiterates its previously announced mid-term 
guidance, based on the assumption that macro-
economic factors normalize over the coming 
years: supply chain issues stabilize, inflation 
drops towards 3%, and challenges accessing 
certain regions reduce. In addition, guidance is 
on the basis that order intake remains solid, 
especially in the Proton Therapy and Industrial 
Solutions businesses. As a reminder, subject to 
these factors, IBA, expects:

IBA – Annual Report 2023 
103. 
 
15% CAGR 2022-2026 on revenues, nearly 
doubling revenues over the next four years 
 
REBIT on sales will reach around 10% by 
2026, delivered gradually and weighted to 
after 2024, as the current macro-economic 
effects 
wane 
and 
operating 
leverage 
accelerates with volume  
 
CAPEX will be around EUR 10-12 million 
per year until 2026 to support increased 
investment in infrastructure, innovation, 
sustainability and digitalization to maintain 
IBA’s leading offering and invest in its future 
growth

company 
incorporated and domiciled in Belgium. The 
address of its registered office is Chemin du 
Cyclotron, 
3; 
B-1348 
Louvain-la-Neuve, 
Belgium. Ion Beam Applications SA is the 
mother Company of the Group and the Ultimate 
Parent. 
The Company is listed on the pan-European 
Euronext stock exchange (B-compartment) and 
is included in the BEL Mid Index. 
IBA publishes condensed half-yearly and 
annual consolidated financial statements which 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as endorsed by EU. 
These consolidated financial statements have 
been approved for release by the Board of 
Directors on March 19, 2024.
1.2. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The consolidated financial statements are:  
 
Prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union (EU). All 
standards and interpretations issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and the International Financial 
Reporting 
Interpretations 
Committee 
(IFRIC) effective year-end 2023 have been 
adopted by the EU. Consequently, the 
accounting policies applied by the Group 
also fully comply with IFRS as issued by the 
IASB. 
 
Prepared on the historical cost basis unless 
otherwise indicated (financial instruments 
such as derivative  and equity investments 
that have been measured at fair value). 
 
Prepared on an accrual basis and on the 
assumption of going concern. 
 
Presented in Euro, which is the Company’s 
functional currency. 
 
Rounded to the nearest thousands unless 
stated otherwise. 
The preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS requires the use of 
certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires Management to exercise judgment in 
the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies. Areas involving a higher 
degree of judgment or complexity, or areas 
where 
assumptions 
and 
estimates 
are 
significant 
to 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements are disclosed in the relevant notes 
refered to in Note 2.6.

2023 
 
Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’: 
International Tax Reform – Pillar Two 
Model Rules (effective 1 January 2023).'  
IFRS 17 insurance contracts 
IFRS 17 is a new accounting standard for 
insurance contracts covering recognition and 
measurement, presentation and disclosure, 
replacing IFRS 4, already amended with 
transition 
option 
regarding 
comparative 
information. 
The group does not issue insurance contracts, 
the financial guarantees that may be issued by 
the Group are treated as financial instruments 
in accordance with IFRS 9. The new standard 
had no impact on the consolidated financial 
statements as from the effective date. 
Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors – Definition of 
accounting estimates 
The IASB issued amendments to IAS 8, in 
which it introduces a definition of ‘accounting 
estimates’. 
The 
amendments 
clarify 
the 
distinction between changes in accounting 
estimates and changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify 
how entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates.

Policies, Changes in Accounting

The IASB issued amendments to IAS 8, in 
which it introduces a definition of ‘accounting 
estimates’. 
The 
amendments 
clarify 
the 
distinction between changes in accounting 
estimates and changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify 
how entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates. 
The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2023 and apply to changes in 
accounting policies and changes in accounting 
estimates that occur on or after the start of that 
period. 
The amendments did not have a material 
impact on the Group as the clarifications are 
confirming the current practices of the Group. 
Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS 
Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of 
Accounting Policies 
The IASB provides guidance and examples to 
help entities apply materiality judgements to 
accounting 
policy 
disclosures. 
The 
amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance on 
how entities apply the concept of materiality in 
making decisions about accounting policy 
disclosures. 
The amendments have had an impact on the 
Group’s disclosures of accounting policies, but 
not on the measurement, recognition or 
presentation of any items in the Group’s 
financial statements. 
Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax 
related to Assets and Liabilities arising 
from a Single Transaction 
In May 2021, the Board issued amendments to 
IAS 12, which narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under IAS 12, so that it no 
longer applies to transactions that give rise to 
equal 
taxable 
and 
deductible 
temporary 
differences. 
The amendments have been applied to 
transactions that occur on or after January 1, 
2023 with no material impacts on both the 
current period and the previous periods 
presented as comparatives.

Amendments to IAS 1 classification of 
liabilities as current or non-current and 
Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants 
The amendments clarify the requirements for 
classifying liabilities as current or non-current. 
In specific, the amendments clarify: 
 
What is meant by a right to defer settlement  
 
That a right to defer must exist at the end of 
the reporting period  
 
That classification is unaffected by the 
likelihood that an entity will exercise its 
deferral right  
 
This right may be subject to the compliance 
to 
covenants 
included 
in 
the 
loan 
agreement, but only the covenants effective 
on or before the end of the reporting period 
could impact the classification 
 
That only if an embedded derivative in a 
convertible liability is itself an equity 
instrument, would the terms of a liability not 
impact its classification 
The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January

and 
must 
be 
applied 
retrospectively. Since the group’s current 
practice is in line with the amendments, the 
Group does not expect any effect on its

The following treatments are applied on 
consolidation:  
 
The carrying amount of the parent’s 
investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of the equity of each 
subsidiary are eliminated;  
 
In the statement of consolidated financial 
position, non-controlling interests in the net 
assets of subsidiaries are identified and 
reported separately in the caption “Non-
controlling interests”;  
 
The portion of the profit or loss of the fully 
consolidated subsidiaries attributable to 
shares held by entities outside the Group is 
presented in the consolidated income 
statement in the caption “Profit/(loss) 
attributable to non-controlling interests”; 
 
Intra-Group balances and transactions and 
unrealized gains and losses on transactions 
between 
Group 
companies 
are 
fully 
eliminated. 
Consolidated financial statements are prepared 
applying uniform accounting policies to like 
transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances. 
1.3.2 Translation of financial 
statements of foreign 
operations 
The financial statements of the Group entities 
are measured using their functional currency, 
which is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which they operate and 
corresponds for most of them to their local 
currency. 
All monetary and non-monetary assets and 
liabilities (including goodwill) are translated to 
euros at the closing rate. Income and expenses 
are translated at the average rate for the month, 
except 
for 
foreign 
operations 
in 
hyperinflationary 
economies 
which 
are 
translated at the closing rate of the year.. 
Differences arising from translation at these 
different rates are recognized directly in equity 
under “Currency translation difference” and 
have no impact on the Income Statement. 
IBA group uses the offical rates published by the 
European Central Bank. Alternatively, when a 
rate is not published by the institution, the 
groupe uses rates from the reputable source 
“Oanda.com”.

DIRECT FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF RUSSIA’S 
INVASION OF UKRAINE
Early 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to 
a myriad of economic and other sanctions 
against Russia, some of which also impact the 
functioning of IBA. 
IBA has a subsidiary in Russia employing about 
25 employees, whose operations have been 
maintained to ensure the operation and 
maintenance of a proton therapy center in 
Dimitrovgrad; the maintenance contract for this 
center has been renewed in 2023 for another 
year. At the same time, the installation of the 
last treatment room is still ongoing. 
We have analyzed the impact of these 
sanctions on the control of IBA SA on its 
Russian subsidiary from a consolidation scope 
perspective, access to its resources, and the 
indicators of asset impairment the conflict may 
raise: 
2.1.1 Control 
We have reviewed whether IBA Group still has 
control over its Russian subsidiary (Ion Beam 
Applications LLC, a 100% subsidiary of IBA 
SA). We have concluded that IBA Group still 
has control over its subsidiary based upon the 
following three aspects:  
 
IBA SA as mother company and IBA 
Group’s 
management 
still 
direct 
the 
activities of the entity; 
 
IBA Russia continues to generate returns 
by continuing the maintenance activities 
that are not subject to any EU sanction;



cash flow forecast indicates an excess cash 
from 
the 
maintenance 
contract. 
Management believes that IBA has still the 
ability to obtain dividend from its Russian 
entity. 
To assess whether IBA Russia is able to fulfill 
its obligations under the contract, we have 
considered the following:  
 
The cash generated by these activities is 
sufficient to cover all local expenses 
incurred 
in 
fullfilling 
IBA 
Russia’s 
obligations under the contract;   
 
The stock of spare parts held on site is 
sufficient to provide for a normal level of 
maintenance service to the site for at least 
12 months; in addition all supplies required 
for the installation contract are already on 
site, ready to be consumed; 
Management has also made the assessment 
that cash can be repatriated in the form of 
dividend as these are not blocked under the 
current sanctions and therefore, IBA has access 
to the liquidities kept in Russia and the ability to 
receive a return from its Russian subsidiary.

ability to obtain dividend from its Russian 
entity. 
To assess whether IBA Russia is able to fulfill 
its obligations under the contract, we have 
considered the following:  
 
The cash generated by these activities is 
sufficient to cover all local expenses 
incurred 
in 
fullfilling 
IBA 
Russia’s 
obligations under the contract;   
 
The stock of spare parts held on site is 
sufficient to provide for a normal level of 
maintenance service to the site for at least 
12 months; in addition all supplies required 
for the installation contract are already on 
site, ready to be consumed; 
Management has also made the assessment 
that cash can be repatriated in the form of 
dividend as these are not blocked under the 
current sanctions and therefore, IBA has access 
to the liquidities kept in Russia and the ability to 
receive a return from its Russian subsidiary. 
2.1.2 Impairment of non-
financial assets 
Assets in Russia  
The non-current assets of the Russian 
subsidiary represent RUB 56.2 million (EUR 0.6 
million) and are composed of a Right of Use 
asset for the lease of the building which is 
renewed on a yearly basis and some deferred 
tax assets on temporary differences. 
The current assets represent RUB 398.1 million 
(EUR 4.1 million) and are the following 
 
Inventory which is being consumed in the 
maintenance project as needed, and for 
which obsolescence has been evaluated 
considering the expected future spare parts 
needs of the site. Given that all parts are 
considered 
as 
recommended 
to 
be 
available 
on 
a 
maintenance 
site, 
Management did not identify excessive 
inventory levels for which additional write off 
should be recognised. 
 
Trade receivable: there are no large 
overdue balances requiring expected credit 
loss allowances and customers have been 
paying regularly, in accordance with the 
contractual terms

 
Contract asset: there are no unusual delays

 
Contract asset: there are no unusual delays 
to be observed on the installation contract 
which indicate a risk of recoverability. 
 
Other assets mainly relate to various tax 
receivables where we do not observe any 
significant risk 
 
Cash: the cash held in the Russian 
subsidiary is kept in RUB 
In conclusion, IBA has assessed that there is no 
risk of impairment on IBA Russia’s assets, 
noting that the net assets of IBA Russia 
amounts to RUB -301.6 million (EUR -3.1 
million). 
Other assets held by IBA Group 
Management has considered whether the 
conflict has an impact on the impairment test 
performed on the goodwill and whether it is an 
indicator of impairment for other non-financial 
assets. 
Goodwill impairment test: the 5-year strategic 
plan used as a basis for the impairment test was 
prepared in December 2023 using the latest 
inflation forecasts taking into account energy 
and transport prices increases, as well as a 
higher discount rate. Despite these prudent 
inputs, the group has sufficient headroom in the 
impairment test to conclude that the risk is 
relatively low. 
The conflict was assessed as having little 
impact on IBA’s global supply chain; the high 
energy prices and other materials costs were 
considered when applying inflation in the 
strategic forecasts of the group. The 
assessment has led to the conclusion that the 
current economic situation does not represent 
an indicator of impairment on IBA group’s 
assets.

2.1.3 Other accounting 
considerations 
IBA does not have cash flow hedge derivatives 
with respect to its activities in Russia, therefore 
no further consideration has been given to the 
application of hedge accounting. 
IBA also considered whether the conflict could 
have an impact on its customers and their ability 
to pay the balances due to IBA; no significant 
additional credit losses were recognised for that 
reason in the year ended December 31, 2023. 
2.2. 
CLIMATE-RELATED MATTERS
Climate related matters are managed by the 
Sustainability Board which meets once a year 
and decides on the Group’s commitments and 
action plans. Three risks categories have been 
identified being strategic risks, process and 
operational risks and product risks; all are 
monitored closely by Management. The risk 
assessment is done once a year and each risk 
is managed internally with a defined process 
which covers the risk identification, the risk 
analysis and scoring, the risk strategy, risk 
mitigation and closure as well as the review and 
monitoring. Several risks and opportunities that 
have been identified as having the higher 
impact on the organization are the following:  
 
Risk: 
Extreme 
weather 
conditions 
(droughts, flooding, tsunami etc): these 
could significantly disrupt the supply chain 
downstream processes of IBA by impacting 
our 
vendors’ 
production 
and 
freight 
capacities and consequently affect our 
revenue. A high level assessment has been 
performed with an expected potential loss 
of revenue of EUR 1.0 million per year.

a result, we foresee a dialogue with our key 
suppliers and the supplier code of conduct, 
as well as the internal sourcing policy which 
will 
be 
amended 
to 
reflect 
stricter 
requirements. 
 
Risk: Carbon pricing mechanisms could 
increase direct costs. IBA has run a 
scenario based on 40 €/tCO2e, in line with 
our internal carbon pricing as used for our  
contribution to the decarbonization program 
of Soil Capital and could result in a EUR 1.0 
million impact on future costs. IBA is 
continuously looking for opportunities to 
offset 
the 
remaining 
part 
of 
the 
organisation’s footprint. 
 
Opportunity: Development of new products 
or services through R&D and innovation: 
IBA continues to invest heavily in research 
and developpement to decrease the energy 
consumtion and CO2 emissions of our 
products, 
giving 
these

to several targets: 
 
Reduction of GHG emissions of our 
infrastructure and mobility by 50% at the 
latest by 2030 (base year 2018):   
 
A decrease of the energy consumption 
of our infrastructure with additional 
solar panels and other smaller scale 
projects such as the installation of more 
energy efficient lights and the renewal 
of and the decarbonization of our 
electricity (scopes 1 and 2), total 
spending of EUR 0.9 million; 
 
The change of our mobility policy to 
transform the current company car fleet 
to 100% electric vehicles 
 
An optimisation program of the sites 
travels for flying engineers with an 
increased use of remote maintenance 
and a better geographic allocation of 
the staff visiting several serviced sites 
 
Reduction by 2/3rd of the unsorted waste 
(base year 2018) to be achieved by waste 
sorting awareness campains, production of 
user-centric sorting rules and new waste 
bins, in offices and manufacturing areas 
 
Decrease of water withdrawal intensity by 
35% below 2020 levels by 2025 expressed 
in m3 per million € revenues or FTE 
From the above analysis and more detailed 
review of all risks and mitigation actions the 
following 
factors 
were 
assessed 
by 
Management:   
 
We do not see climate issues having an 
impact on the outcome of the impairment 
test of the goodwill, nor on the useful lives 
of our non-current assets as IBA does not 
foresee an early replacement of its 
infrastructure and facilities; 
 
We have not identified any additional risk of 
expected 
credit 
loss 
on 
our 
trade 
receivables and other financial assets; 
 
As the commitments for carbon emissions 
reductions, waste management and water 
consumtion described above relate to future 
events and actions are to be taken, we have 
not 
identified 
constructive 
obligations 
resulting from these commitments, nor the 
need to record any operational onerous 
contract provisions other than those already 
presented in these consolidated financial 
statements; 
 
Currently, IBA is not involved in emission 
trading schemes (even though investments 
are made in  Carbon Farming, these are not 
allowed for compensation activities as they 
are outside IBA’s value chain).

 
Opportunity: it is observed that employee 
attractivity and retention is increasingly 
impacted by the continuous investments 
made by IBA in being a sustainable 
company. 
In order to mitigate the risks and contribute 
positively to climate change, IBA is committed 
to several targets: 
 
Reduction of GHG emissions of our 
infrastructure and mobility by 50% at the 
latest by 2030 (base year 2018):   
 
A decrease of the energy consumption 
of our infrastructure with additional 
solar panels and other smaller scale 
projects such as the installation of more 
energy efficient lights and the renewal 
of and the decarbonization of our 
electricity (scopes 1 and 2), total 
spending of EUR 0.9 million; 
 
The change of our mobility policy to 
transform the current company car fleet 
to 100% electric vehicles 
 
An optimisation program of the sites 
travels for flying engineers with an 
increased use of remote maintenance 
and a better geographic allocation of 
the staff visiting several serviced sites 
 
Reduction by 2/3rd of the unsorted waste 
(base year 2018) to be achieved by waste 
sorting awareness campains, production of 
user-centric sorting rules and new waste 
bins, in offices and manufacturing areas 
 
Decrease of water withdrawal intensity by 
35% below 2020 levels by 2025 expressed 
in m3 per million € revenues or FTE 
From the above analysis and more detailed 
review of all risks and mitigation actions the 
following 
factors 
were 
assessed 
by 
Management:   
 
We do not see climate issues having an 
impact on the outcome of the impairment 
test of the goodwill, nor on the useful lives 
of our non-current assets as IBA does not 
foresee an early replacement of its 
infrastructure and facilities; 
 
We have not identified any additional risk of 
expected 
credit 
loss 
on 
our 
trade 
receivables and other financial assets; 
 
As the commitments for carbon emissions 
reductions, waste management and water 
consumtion described above relate to future 
events and actions are to be taken, we have 
not 
identified 
constructive 
obligations 
resulting from these commitments, nor the 
need to record any operational onerous 
contract provisions other than those already 
presented in these consolidated financial 
statements; 
 
Currently, IBA is not involved in emission 
trading schemes (even though investments 
are made in  Carbon Farming, these are not 
allowed for compensation activities as they 
are outside IBA’s value chain). In addition, 
IBA has not signed any Power Purchase 
Agreement for the supply of green energy 
as these are deemed too expensive for IBA 
due to the energy price level at the time of 
the investigation done by IBA; 
 
Our 
forecast 
transactions 
remain 
sufficiently certain and cautious to ensure 
that 
effectiveness 
of 
our 
derivatives 
financial instruments is maintained to 
qualify for hedge accounting; 
2.3. 
MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
Management has considered several factors 
related to the macro-economic environment and 
their impact on impairment of non-financial 
assets, expected credit losses, provisions, 
revenue 
recognition, 
hedge 
accounting, 
pension plans, deferred tax and going concern. 
When preparing the budget for 2024 and the 
medium-term 
strategic 
plan, 
the 
macro-
economic conditions were taken into account 
for the assumptions and forecast transactions. 
IBA’s order intake remains strong and the 
backlog is increasing, therefore reducing 
uncertainty on future revenues.

entities and that the deferred tax assets are 
recoverable. 
We explain how several macro-economic 
factors where taken into account below: 
2.3.1 High inflation 
 
Impairment: in preparing the goodwill 
impairment tests and in reviewing indicators 
of impairment, Management has taken into 
consideration a high inflation in the forecast 
costs in the budget and strategic financial 
plans. Given the available headroom, this 
had no impact on the conclusion of the 
impairment test. 
 
Revenue 
recognition 
and 
Onerous 
contracts: most contracts signed by IBA 
have an indexation clause linked to 
inflation. The costs to complete of each 
significant 
equipment 
and 
installation 
contract 
as 
well 
as 
operation 
and 
maintenance contrat have been reviewed 
with the latest price increases and expected 
future inflation. 
 
Pension plan provision: inflation was also 
factored in the actuarial assumptions used 
for the calculation of the provision for the 
defined benefit pension plan, although only 
the long-term inflation is relevant for these 
calculations. 
 
Expected credit losses on loans and 
receivables: the amount and timing of the 
expected credit losses, as well as the 
probability assigned thereto, has been 
based on the available information at the 
end of year 2023, including a consideration 
on the impact of inflation on our customers.

based on the available information at the 
end of year 2023, including a consideration 
on the impact of inflation on our customers. 
As a result of this review, no additional 
credit losses for customers facing financial 
difficulties were recognised. 
2.3.2 High interest rates 
The increase in interest rates were reflected in 
a higher WACC used in the discounting of the 
future cash flows in the impairment model. 
In addition, the discount rates used in the 
actuarial assumptions of the defined benefit 
plan were increased, leading to a decrease of 
the provision. This was partially offset by a 
decrease of the return on the plan assets as we 
observe a decline in stock markets. 
The interest-bearing borrowings that IBA has 
are fixed-rate instruments with no uncertainty 
on the timing and amount of future cash flows. 
2.4. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO PANTERA SA/NV 
In 2022, IBA established a strategic R&D 
partnership as a Joint Venture with SCK-CEN 
(Belgian Nuclear Research Center). Both 
entities participate for 50% of the share capital 
with an initial contribution of EUR 0.3 million. 
The JV is established in Belgium and will be 
active in the nuclear medicine, more specifically 
it will develop, produce and distribute the 
isotope Ac.225. The R&D project is still at a 
very early stage but the JV has secured some 
early supply of Ac.225 via a partnership with 
TerraPower  Isotopes. 
In 2023, both IBA and SCK-CEN made further 
equal contributions to the capital of PanTera 
SA/NV. IBA contributed EUR 16.0 million in 
cash which has been used immediately by 
Pantera to purchase a Rhodotron from IBA.

cash which has been used immediately by 
Pantera to purchase a Rhodotron from IBA. 
The transaction is considered as a “quasi 
apport” by Belgian Company Law, hence 
assimilated as a contribution in kind. IBA will 
recognise the sale of the equipment in 
accordance with the revenue recognition 
accounting 
policy, 
over 
time 
using 
the 
percentage of completion method. The 
equipment remains unbuilt at the closing date 
and the payment received in full is accounted 
for as a contract liability. The margin on the 
revenue from the sale of the equipment will be 
recognised only to the extent of unrelated 
investors’ interest in the J.V. 
IBA also contributed IP in kind  to Pantera for a 
value of EUR 4.4 million. The gain on this 
transaction has been recognised only to the 
extent of unrelated investors’ interests, being 
50%, against  “Other operating income”. 
Both venturers have also  granted a convertible 
loan to Pantera  for an amount up to EUR 1.0 
million which was fully drawn upon during the 
financial year. The loan bears interests at a rate 
of 6% per year and has a term of 3 years. The 


=== Page 127 ===
IBA – Annual Report 2023 
124. 
loan can be converted into shares with the 
conversion price set in the agreement  if some 
conditions are met, in which case interests are 
forfeited. Given the materiality, interests have 
been accrued and the fair value of the equity 
element has not been determined separately.

In preparing these consolidated financial 
statements, management is required to make 
estimates and judgements that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities,

The application of accounting policies requires 
judgements 
that

Accounting policy for business combinations 
Business combinations:  
All business combinations (acquisitions of businesses) are accounted for using the acquisition method. During the purchase 
price allocation process, IBA determines the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, liabilities, and contingent 
liabilities and allocates the consideration to these. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is measured at fair value and includes any contingent 
consideration. It is common to have an element of variable consideration such as an earn out which is contingent to the 
future performance of the acquired business. IBA makes an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration at the 
acquisition date; subsequent changes to the fair value that is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in profit or 
loss. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and presented under Other Operating expenses. 
Goodwill  
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest 
over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is a gain from a bargain purchase and is recognized in profit or loss. 
Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment annually (or more frequently if circumstances so require).

The significant revenue streams are detailed below, consistently with the business review presented in the management report 
*Financial intercompany position between segments is excluded from the assets and liabilities of the segment. 
For the year-ended December 31, 2023, the 
Group revenue was EUR 428.7 million, a 18.7% 
increase from 2022 (2022: EUR 361.3 million), 
primarily composed of: 
 
External revenues for the Proton Therapy 
and Other Accelerators segment of EUR 
366.4 million representing an increase of 
18.65% from 2022 (2022: 308.8 EUR  
million): 
 
the revenue of Proton Therapy activities 
amounts to EUR 229.1 million (2022: 
EUR 218.8 million), showing a slow 
increase of 4.7% due to a slow backlog 
conversion in H1 as well as significant 
costs at completion increases following 
a high inflation ; 
 
the revenue of Other Accelerators 
activities amounts to EUR 133.7 million 
(2022: EUR 88.5 million), showing a 
significant increase of 51.1% thanks to a 
good backlog conversion with a high 
delivery volume and a solid order intake 
in H1;

operating expenses were EUR 128.0 million, a

Administrative expenses for EUR 53.8 million, 
Sales and Marketing expenses for EUR 26.3 
million and Research and Development net of 
research credit for EUR 47.9 million. Despite 
efficient control of overhead costs, careful 
spending and IBA’s cost control measures, the 
increase is to be observed on all three types of 
expenses and reflects the conditions of the 
general macro-economic environment, however 
the increase is mainly to be seen on Research

(2022: EUR -6.1 million); it mainly includes some 
reorganisation expenses for EUR 2.5 million and

EUR 1.0 million, offset by a net gain on the 
contribution in kind of the IP to the group’s new 
Joint Venture Pantera for EUR 2.2 million (net of

Accounting policy for Operating segments 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision maker (CODM), being the Management Team who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments. On the basis of its internal financial reports and given the Group’s primary source 
of risk and profitability, IBA has identified two operating segments:  
- 
Proton therapy and other accelerators: This segment constitutes the technological basis of the Group’s many 
businesses and encompasses development, fabrication, and services associated with medical and industrial 
particle accelerators and proton therapy systems. 
- 
Dosimetry: This segment includes the activities that offer a full range of innovative high-quality solutions and 
services that maximize efficiency and minimize errors in radiation therapy and medical imaging Quality

Accounting policy for Operating segments 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision maker (CODM), being the Management Team who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments. On the basis of its internal financial reports and given the Group’s primary source 
of risk and profitability, IBA has identified two operating segments:  
- 
Proton therapy and other accelerators: This segment constitutes the technological basis of the Group’s many 
businesses and encompasses development, fabrication, and services associated with medical and industrial 
particle accelerators and proton therapy systems. 
- 
Dosimetry: This segment includes the activities that offer a full range of innovative high-quality solutions and 
services that maximize efficiency and minimize errors in radiation therapy and medical imaging Quality 
Assurance and calibration procedures. 
The segment results, assets and liabilities include the items directly related to a segment, as well as those that may be 
allocated on a reasonable basis. 
The segment investment expenses include the total cost of investments incurred during the period of acquisition of tangible 
and intangible assets investments, except goodwill.

Accounting policy on revenue recognition 
IBA has the following revenue streams which will determine how the revenue is recognised. 
• 
Equipment and installation services 
The main activity of the Group consists of the construction of proton-therapy and other accelerators equipment and the 
installation services for its customers. Such contracts with customers are referred to as equipment and installation services, 
it represents the most important portion of IBA’s revenue. 
• 
Services 
The Group provides operation and maintenance services which relate to the daily functioning and maintenance activity of 
the proton therapy centers once those have been transferred to the customer. 
• 
Licence revenue 
Occasionally, IBA group sells a licence for the intellectual property. This is not part of IBA’s main business activity and 
will, in most cases, constitute a distinct performance obligation. 
• 
Dosimetry 
IBA Dosimetry develops solutions that give medical staff the quality assurance tools and softwares to obtain the treatment 
results they need.

Expected contract costs comprise: 
- 
Direct and indirect production costs (e.g., resources consumed, labour hours expended, costs incurred, time 
elapsed or machine hours used); 
- 
Such other costs as are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract;

- 
Costs incurred in securing the contract if they can be separately identified and measured reliably and if it is 
probable that the contract will be obtained. 
Transaction price 
The transaction price sometimes relates to a promised bundle package or services to a customer which comprises the 
equipment, installation and an agreed number of years of operation and maintenance of the site. The allocation of the price 
to the performance obligations is done based on the standard selling price of each component, driven by budget and taking 
into accounts some contract negotiation considerations. IBA’s contract with the customers typically does not contain 
variable amounts and the financing component is also considered to be non-significant as milestones payments are spread 
over the project and reflect the progress of IBA in fulfilling its obligations.. 
Contract assets and liabilities 
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer and is recognised 
when the group has transferred goods or services to a customer before being contractually entitled to payment.

Contract assets and liabilities 
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer and is recognised 
when the group has transferred goods or services to a customer before being contractually entitled to payment. 
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer and will be recognized as revenue when the Group 
performs under the contract. 
Trade receivables  
A receivable represents IBA’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional. Trade receivables will be 
recognised when a milestone included in the contract has been reached, which is usually a significant progress step in the 
completion of the contractual obligations. 
Refund liabilities  
A refund liability is recognised for consideration that IBA has received in advance from a customer and expects to refund 
to the customer, and is measured at the amount of consideration received for which the entity does not expect to be entitled 
(ie amounts not included in the transaction price). 
Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
 
Combining performance obligations: 
The equipment and installation services are always contracted and sold as a bundle package. Thisis because the equipment 
is specialized in nature and only IBA can provide the installation services to the customers. As a result, IBA promises relate 
to the transfer of a combined output integrating both the promised equipment and relating installation services.

determined that due to the nature of its promises, the equipment and installation services contract have to be considered as 
one performance obligation. 
Timing of revenue recognition:  
The Group assessed that its performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created. In 
addition its performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and it has concluded that, at all 
times, it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Therefore, control transfers over time and 
the Group recognizes revenue by measuring the progress using the input method on the basis of the costs incurred which 
are compared to the total expected cost of the project (formerly referred to as “percentage of completion”). 
Measurement of the costs to fulfill an obligation:  
The Group recognises revenue over time under contracts for the sales of equipments and the progress is measured by 
reference to the costs incurred when comparing it to the total estimated costs of the contract. The  total estimated costs of 
the contract is a significant estimate because it determines the progress made since the inception of the contract and IBA 
recognises the revenue of the contract based on the progress estimated in percentage. 
Licensing contract with CGN:  
In August 2020, the group signed a technology license agreement with CGN Dasheng Electron Accelerator Technology Co., 
Ltd for the provision of goods and services related to its Multi-Room Proton Therapy System.

December 2023, it was agreed with CGN to cancel the remaining portion of the performance bond which was finally 
forfeited in January 2024 after finalisation of the administrative processes of both CGN and the bank. Given that the 
uncertainty attached to the bond is now fully removed, IBA Group has released the remaining EUR 5 million of the variable

Contract termination: 
Depending on the contract terms with the customers, IBA may terminate a sale contract when the counterpart is in breach 
of the contract terms. Management always focusses on finding a solution with the customer through negotiations but in 
some rare circumstances, contracts may need to be terminated to mitigate risks and losses for the Group. If after negotiation 
no agreement has been reached, a termination letter will be sent. Deposits and non-refundable milestone payments can be 
recognised as revenue in the income statement; this will only be accounted for by the Group after a reasonable amount of 
time, which is once the risk of any further claims from the customer is deemed sufficiently low to avoid future reversal of 
revenue.

The 
impact 
of 
hyperinflation 
represents 
primarely the revaluation of non-monetary items  
following the application of IAS 29 on the 
Argentinian subsidiary. Most of the impact is 
derived from the revaluation of the contract 
liability position on the installation contract which 
started early 2023. 
The increase in the argentinian official index in 
2023 was 211%. The contract liability position 
being the billing in excess of the revenue 
recognised on the installation project was a 
significant non monetary item and has resulted 
in a revaluation impact of EUR 1.9 million. IBA 
has issued large milestone invoices throughout 
the period which have all been indexed to the 
index as at December 31, 2023. The revenue 
of the year was relatively limited due to the 
project starting later in the year, the revenue has 
also been brought the closing index.

Accounting policy for transactions in foreign currencies 
Foreign currency transactions are converted into the functional currency of the Group entity party to the transaction, using 
the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The functional currency of each subsidiary of the group is 
the official currency of the countries where they are established. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the conversion at the period-
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in financial expenses 
and income in the income statement. 
Foreign exchange differences arising from long-term loans that are part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations 
are reclassified to equity as cumulative translation difference via the Other Comprehensive Income.

TAXATION 
4.6.1 Income tax expense 
The tax profit/(charge) for the year can be broken down as follows: 
 
The tax profit on IBA’s result before taxes differs 
from the theoretical amount that would have 
resulted from application of the average 
applicable tax rates to the profits of the 
consolidated companies. The analysis is as 
follows:
The theoritical tax rate presented here above is 
a weighted average nominal rate of IBA group 
and therefore is strongly impacted by the 
disparity of profit and losses made in different 
jurisdictions with different tax rates. In addition, 
it is calculated using the contribution of each 
entity, which can difer significantly from the  profit 
and loss included in tax returns due to GAAP 
differences and local adjustments. 
   
 
 
Hyperinflation : 
IBA as operations in Argentina, which qualifies for hyperinflation accounting since 2018. The Argentina government 
published the monthly indices as officially defined by local resolutions “RT Indice 6”. 
Under IAS 29, IBA has revalued the net monetary position of IBA Argentina’s subsidiary to the closing index as well as the 
revenue and expenses. Furthermore, the indexed financial position and income statement of the Company have been 
translated to the group currency at the closing exchange rate instead of the average of each month.

combination in 2022 represents the temporary 
difference on the intangible assets with a finite 
useful life recognised as part of the purchase 
price allocation exercise  done on the 
acquisition of Modus.

The main driver of the decrease is the 
decrease of the deferred tax assets on the tax 
losses carried forward in Belgium by EUR 1.7 
million following the revision of the strategic plan 
prepared by Management. 
As at December 31, 2023, the Group had 
accumulated tax losses of EUR 157.0  million 
(2022: EUR 162.7  million) usable to offset future 
profits taxable mainly in Belgium and in Germany 
and temporary differences for which the tax base 
amounts to EUR 66.9 million (2021: EUR 65.0 
million) mainly in Belgium, the United States, 
Germany and Russia. The Group recognized 
deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried 
forward for EUR 13.6 million with the view to 
using these in future years and EUR 3.7 million 
as deferred tax assets and liabilities for 
temporary differences. 
In 2023 and in 2022, the recognized temporary 
differences are mainly related to taxable 
deferred revenues, non-deductible allowance for 
doubtful accounts, expenses accrual and 
inventory in the US entities.

Accounting policy on taxes 
Current income taxes:  
Management is not expecting that the requirements of Pillar II will be applicable to IBA Group as the turnover threshold is 
not met. 
Tax incentives: 
R&D tax credit: IBA is eligible for a tax credit on the R&D investments and the tax credits are carried forward up to 5 
years (4 years until 2022), after which point these are reimbursed. IBA accounts for these as a direct deduction from the 
R&D expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As most of these tax credits are not immediately utilizable by 
IBA SA, a long-term asset is recognised. 
Deferred taxes: 
A deferred tax asset on deductible temporary differences and on unused tax losses carried forward is only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference and/or tax 
losses can be utilized.

years of taxable results. 
Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
 
Local taxation exposure 
Since 2015, the Company initiated an analysis on the Group’s exposure in countries other than Belgium to be potentially 
obliged to pay certain local taxes whereas the payment of those taxes has been transferred to the Group’s customers. The 
exposure identified as of December 31, 2015, was reduced as a result of further investigations. Management is monitoring 
this risk closely and regularly, however, based on the data available today, it is still not possible to make a reliable estimate 
of the remaining exposure and therefore no provision has been accrued for in the Group‘s financial statements. 
Recoverability of deferred tax assets 
The Group recognizes deferred tax assets on unused losses carried forward to the extent that the taxable profit against 
which these assets are available can be used. The amounts recognized in the financial position are prudent estimates made 
on the basis of recent financial plans approved by the Board of Directors and depend on certain judgments with respect to 
the amounts and location of the future taxable profits of the Group’s subsidiaries and parent company. In 2022, a deferred 
tax asset of EUR 10.9 million was recognised on the tax losses carried forward in Belgium which was previously not 
recognised.

nearly double its revenues at the end of the term covered by the plan with a REBIT to sales ratio of 8%, relying on the 
assumption that the macro-economic factors normalize over the coming year. The group reversed EUR 1.7 million in 2023 
following the revision of the latest plan, however, Management remains confident in its capacity to develop the business in 
the coming years and deliver value to all of its stakeholders.

Accounting policy for intangible assets 
Goodwill: the accounting policy for recognising and measuring goodwill is described in Note 3, Business 
combinations 
Software, research and development and other intangible assets:Expenditures for the development of new products and 
software are recognized as intangible assets if such expenditures, with a high degree of certainty, will result in future 
economic benefits for the company. IBA applies the criteria strictly and in most cases development costs are expensed when 
incurred. 
Amortisation: 
Each asset is amortised over its useful life using the straight-line method and assets are not revalued. 
The table below summarises the amortization periods for the main categories of intangible assets: 
INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS 
Useful life 
Product development costs  
3 years, except if a longer useful life is justified (however not 
exceeding 5 years) 
IT development costs for the primary software programs (e.q. ERP) 
5 years, except if a longer useful life is justified 
Other software  
3 years 
Concessions, patents, licenses, know-how, trademarks, and other similar 
rights 
3 years, except if a longer useful life is justified

Dynamitron 
business, 
which 
have 
been 
recorded in “Other operating expenses” for EUR 
0.4 million. 
In 2023, we observe a significant incerase of 
new leased cars which follows the increase in 
headcount but also 2022 was impacted by 
important delivery delays in the car industry. 
The other significant addition to fixed assets 
relates to the installation of the new solar 
carports on IBA’s premises as well as some 
major repairs on the older buildings. 
The additions to the leased buildings are mainly 
due to contracts that were near the term which 
have been prolonged. 
In 2023 and 2022, additional investments were 
also made for IT equipment. 
In 2023 and 2022, the disposals of tangible 
assets mainly correspond to the scrapping of 
unused assets by the Group as well as leases 
that came to the end of contracts and that were 
not renewed. 
Accounting policy for tangible fixed assets 
Owned assets:  
Most assets are large structural enhancements made to buildings that are leased by IBA. The acquisition cost only included 
third party invoices which were directly attributable to the work performed on these assets. Internal resources are usually 
not capitalised unless it can be demonstrated that these are directly attributable to the asset being constructed and these 
can be measured. In addition, no borrowing costs have been capitalised. 
Each asset is depreciated over its useful life using the straight-line method; assets are not revalued. 
Leased assets: 
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets. The Group recognizes a lease liability estimating the future lease payments and a corresponding right-
of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. 
The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is 
available for use).

The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is

following a revision of the lease term or a change in the future lease payments. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method and are subject to impairment.

Lease term: 
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an 
option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the 
lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. 
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in 
evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it 
considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After

IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
IBA does not have tangible nor intangible 
assets with indefinite useful life, other than 
goodwill. 
 
Despite 
the 
macro-economic 
conditions and other events of the year 
described in Note 2, IBA did not identify any 
indication of impairment on assets in 2023 and 
2022 financial years. 
5.3.1 Goodwill impairment 
testing:  
The goodwill recognised on the acquisition of 
Modus Medical Devices Inc, relates to the 
Dosimetry business and has been added to the 
CGU of Dosimetry given the cross synergies that 
will arise from this acquisition. 
The goodwill generated by an acquisition is 
allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) 
concerned and an impairment test is carried out 
annually on the CGUs’ fixed assets (including 
goodwill). 
The following table summarizes allocation of the 
carrying amount of goodwill by operating 
segment:

(1) The pre tax discount rate used has been derived from the WACC specific to Dosimetry entities. 
(2) Rate consistent with expected growth in the sector. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been 
determined on a “value in use” basis. 
For the CGU Dosimetry, if the growth rate is 
decreased by 100 basis points and the discount 
rate is increased by 100 basis points, the 
recoverable amount remains greater than the 
carrying amount of the tested assets. No 
impairment was identified in 2023 and in 2022. 
the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that 
is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate. 
Discount rate: 
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate 
(IBR) to measure lease liabilities.

Discount rate: 
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate 
(IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that IBA would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, 
and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group ‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when no 
observable rates are available (such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing transactions) or when they need to 
be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (for example, when leases are not in the subsidiary’s functional 
currency). 
The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make 
certain entity-specific estimates (such as the subsidiary’s stand-alone credit rating).

Accounting policy for impairment of assets 
As the Group does not carry any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life,  IBA is only testing the goodwill 
recognised on business combinations annually for impairment, after the latest strategic plan has been approved by 
Management. 
All other assets are depreciated or amortised and are tested for impairment only if there is an indicator that an asset is 
impaired; management monitors closely the past and future performance of each segment as well as other internal and 
external factors through regular meetings, performance reviews, discussions with third parties and other stakeholders. 
Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated among the Group’s cash-generating units (CGU) that are 
expected to benefit from synergies as a result of the business combination. This allocation is based on Management’s 
assessment of the synergies gained. 
Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
 
Value in use and goodwill impairment test:  
When management considers that there is a risk of impairment, the recoverable amounts of tangible and intangible assets 
are determined on a “value in use” basis. Value in use is determined on the basis of cash-flows coming from IBA’s most 
recent business plans (4-years horizon), as approved by the Board of Directors in the context of the strategic plan.

margins, and investments will evolve. 
The cash flows beyond a four-year period have been extrapolated using the growth rates and the testing uses gross budgeted 
operational margins estimated by management on the basis of past performance. 
The discount rates used reflect the specific risks related to the segments in question.

Normandy Hadrontherapy SAS 
Since June 2019, IBA ownership in Normandy 
Hadrontherapy SAS remained at 39.81 % (no 
change from 2019) of this entity following 
financing by several public and private players. 
The objective of this project is to launch the 
development of the world’s first cyclotron-based 
carbon therapy system in Caen, France through 
its subsidiary Normandy Hadrontherapy (NHa), 
in collaboration with the Normandy Region and 
several other private and public players, 
including 
SAPHYN 
(SAnté 
et 
PHYsique 
Nucléaire). 
The overall investment by all partners in NHa is 
over EUR 60 million, in equity and bond 
financing 
(guaranteed 
by 
the 
Normandy 
Region). IBA’s contribution amounted to EUR 6 
million in equity and EUR 1,5 million in 
convertible Bond financing (see note 6.2.3). 
IBA’s investment also includes the sale of 
intellectual property related to the Cyclone®400 
cyclotron to NHa. The gain on this transaction 
amounted to EUR 5 million which was reduced 
by EUR 2 million (39.81%) for unrealized gain in 
2019.

(Belgian Nuclear Research Center). Both 
entities participate for 50% of the share capital 
with an initial contribution of EUR 0.3 million. 
The JV is established in Belgium and will be 
active in nuclear medicine, more specifically it 
will develop, produce and distribute the isotope 
Ac-225.

Accounting policy for associates and Joint Ventures 
An associate is an entity in which IBA has significant influence, but which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint 
venture. Joint ventures (JVs) are the arrangements in which IBA has joint control. Associates and JVs are accounted for 
using the equity method. When IBA’s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture, the 
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that IBA has 
committed to further contributions to that associate or JV.

 
Investment at fair value – level 3: HIL for 
EUR -3.0 million (2022: EUR 1.0 million). 
HIL Applied Medical Ltd  
In 2016, the Group invested USD 2.0 million 
(EUR 1.8 million) in HIL Applied Medical Ltd, a 
private Israeli developer of laser-based proton 
therapy systems which is developing a novel, 
patented approach to particle acceleration and 
delivery, combining nano-technology with ultra-
high-intensity lasers and ultra-fast magnets. 
This potential technological breakthrough could 
enable a meaningful reduction in the size and 
cost of proton therapy systems without 
compromising clinical utility. Alongside this 
investment, IBA and HIL have signed an 
Original 
Equipment 
Manufacturer 
(OEM) 
agreement which gives IBA the right to 
purchase HIL’s laser-based proton accelerators 
for the purpose of integrating them into proton 
therapy solutions. 
In 2022, IBA has recorded a value increase of 
the investment by EUR 1.0 million against the 
Group’s Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income, based on a valuation exercise using 
the DCF method and future cash flow forecasts. 
In July 2023, the investee has formally informed 
the stakeholder of the financial difficulties 
encountered and the start of a voluntary 
dissolution. As a result, the value of the 
investment has been decreased to zero, 
representing a loss of EUR 3.0 million (against 
the group’s Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income).

In 2022, the Group took a minority stake of SEK

This 
investment 
represents 
a 
 
10.11% 
ownership of the issued capital. 
The company is a listed group on the Swedish 
stock exchange, the investment is held at fair 
value based on its share price at the end of the 
reporting period with changes recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income. In 2023, this 
reassessment at fair value decreased the value 
of the investment by EUR 0.2 million against the 
Group’s Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income (cumulative impact on reserves of EUR 
0.4 million as at December 31, 2023). 
Invest.BW SA  
On January 1st, 2023, the Group acquired 7 500 
shares of Invest.BW S.A. As IBA was already 
holding 150 shares from a previous capital 
increase, IBA is now holding 25% of the issued 
shares of Invest.BW SA. InvestBW is providing 
financing and support to entrepreneurs in 
Walloon Brabant, as a venture capital partner 
InvestBW is an investment fund representing 
equity and subordinated or convertible loan to 
entrepreneurs. Although it is presumed that, 
with 25% of the shares, IBA has a significant 
influence over InvestBW, we have rebutted the 
significant influence on the basis that IBA 
currently has made the choice to not participate 
in the decision making process of InvestBW. 
The investment is accounted for as an equity 
investment financial asset under IFRS9, at fair 
value and gains and losses will be recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income. Given that the 
shares were recently acquired, the price paid is 
considered as the fair value of the investment.

Accounting policy for other shares and participations 
Other shares and participations represents the holding of shares in which IBA does not hold a significant 
influence. These are carried at fair value and are not held for trading, IBA has designated these investments as FVOCI 
whereby all changes in fair value are recognised in OCI and will never recycle in profit and loss. 
Accounting policy for inventories 
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
The cost of inventories that are ordinarily interchangeable is allocated by using the weighted average cost formula. The 
same cost formula is used for all inventories that have a similar nature and use to the entity. 
The assembled items of inventory is based on the weighted average cost of the raw materials included in the “Bill of 
Materials” and the planned labour and overhead costs. Any variances with actual costs is included in the line “Cost of 
Goods Sold” in the consolidated statement of income. 
The net realizable value is assessed by reviewing the ageing of each individual inventory item and the value of inventory is 
adjusted for obsolescence and slow moving items with the following policy   
• 
If no movement after 1 year: write-off over 3 years; 
• 
If movement occurs after write-off: reversal of write-off.

 EQUITY 
As December 31, 2023, 49.11% of IBA’s stock 
was traded on Euronext. Full details of the 
Group’s shareholders are set out in the section 
“The stock market and shareholders” of this 
annual report. In 2023, the General Assembly 
has approved a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share 
as recommended by IBA’s Board of Directors, for 
a total amount of EUR 6.1 million, which has 
been paid during the year. 
IBA’s Board of Directors intends to recommend 
to the General Assembly to pay a dividend of 
EUR 0.17 per share in 2024 in order to retain an 
engaged long-term shareholding. 
Based on the number of shares eligible to a 
dividend as at December 3, 2023, this 
represents a total amount of EUR 5.0 millions.
The following table shows the movements in the outstanding number of shares over the last two years: 
Accounting policy for trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are held by IBA to collect the related cash flows. Trade receivables, other receivables and 
prepayment are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method less impairment losses. 
Most of the time, the discounting impact is not significant and receivables are therefore measured at nominal value. 
In calculating, the expected credit loss, the Group uses an allowance matrix based on ageing balances adjusted for forward-
looking factors linked to a specific customer. The matrix used is as follow: 
 
25% after 90 days overdue; 
 
50% after 180 days overdue; 
 
75% after 270 days overdue; 
 
100% after 360 days overdue. 
The credit loss is further reviewed in detail to take into consideration other customer specific factors such as 
re-negotiation, customer refinancing, and guarantees received.

For large Proton Therapy contracts, such analysis is performed considering the overall position of the contract, taking into 
account trade receivable, contract asset and contract liabilities. As such, ECL allowances are rarely recognised when the 
revenue recognised on the project is lower than the paid invoices. 
Accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to 
be cash equivalents.

are held by the Group to cover the Stock Option 
Plans and have been acquired in the previous 
years with the aim of hedging against share price 
fluctuations. 
In 2023, the changes of ‘’Revaluation reserves - 
Equity instruments at fair value through Profit or 
Loss” is related to the reevaluation at fair value 
of the other investment in ScandiDos A.B (EUR 
-0.2 million) and HIL applied Medical Ltd (EUR -
2.8 million), see Note 5.5. 
The decrease of “Other reserves – Defined

Following the terms of the S.R.I.W. and S.F.P.I. 
bond agreements, the Group agreed to comply 
with a financial covenant relating to the IBA 
Group level of equity, which was met as at 
December 31, 2023. 
Available bank credit facilities 
As at December 31, 2023, the Group has at its 
disposal credit facilities amounting to EUR 83.1 
million of which 23.4% are used (23.4% in 2022). 
The bank facilities at IBA SA level include a EUR 
40 million revolving credit facility (increase of 
EUR 3.0 million compared to 2022, following a 
re-negociation). 
 
The financial covenants applying to these 
syndicated facilities consist of (a) a maximum net 
leverage ratio (calculated as the consolidated 
net 
senior 
indebtedness 
divided 
by 
the 
consolidated REBITDA over the last 12 months) 
and (b) a minimum corrected equity level  
(calculated as the sum of the consolidated equity 
- with certain reclassifications - and the 
subordinated indebtedness). Both covenants 
were complied with as at December 31, 2023.

Dynamitron business wind down not yet 
incurred as described in Note 4.4. 
Movements can be detailed as follows: 
 
New warranty provisions primarily in 
relation to Proton therapy and other 
accelerators amounting to EUR 4.2 
million following delivery of several 
projects to customers. 
 
New 
provisions 
for 
the 
onerous 
maintenance contracts for EUR 1.8 
million. This increase results from the 
reforecast and increased losses on 1 
contract 
that 
became 
onerous 
previously. The main assumptions used 
were a 2% yearly inflation, cost savings 
initiatives and a discount rate of 2% to 
reflect the impact of time. 
 
Utilisation and reversals of onerous 
contract provision for maintenance 
contracts which have been revised 
and/or re-negotiated with customers for 
EUR 3.3 million. 
 
Reversals of warranty provisions in 
relation to Proton therapy and other 
accelerators amounting to EUR -2.5 
million following the end of warranty 
periods.

5.11.1 Defined employee benefit 
In Belgium, the Group operates a contribution-
based plan funded through payments to an 
insurance company. The employer guarantees a 
minimum return on employer contributions 
resulting in a financial risk to be borne by the 
Group. 
Since January 1, 2016, the Group uses the 
projected unit credit method. 
In India, the Group also operates a defined 
benefit pension plan, for which the benefit liability 
is EUR 0.1 million as at December 31, 2023. 
Given the immateriality of that plan, only the plan 
in Belgium is presented below. Changes in the 
present value of defined benefit obligations are 
presented as follows:
Accounting policy for provisions 
The main categories of provisions are recognised as follow: 
Warranty provision 
Most equipment sales have the legal contractual warranty for a period of 1 year and the warranty period starts when the 
equipment is accepted by the customer. Provisions for product warranty are recognized as cost of sales. 
Onerous contract provision 
If IBA has an onerous contract (that is, if the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it), the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision 
against cost of sales. The provision is reassessed at least 3 times a year. 
 
The group applies the most likely amount method to estimate these provisions 
Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
 
Onerous contracts for services: 
The Group recognises a provision of onerous contract when the unavoidable costs of fullfilling the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received. This is the case when a service contract is expected to generate negative margin 
in the remaining years.

Onerous contracts for services: 
The Group recognises a provision of onerous contract when the unavoidable costs of fullfilling the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received. This is the case when a service contract is expected to generate negative margin 
in the remaining years. For each contract presenting a risk, the expected margin for the remaining years of the initial term 
is calculated based on the latest available reforecast of the future costs to complete IBA’s obligations. The margin is then 
discounted using a risk-free rate.

This is the case when a service contract is expected to generate negative margin 
in the remaining years. For each contract presenting a risk, the expected margin for the remaining years of the initial term 
is calculated based on the latest available reforecast of the future costs to complete IBA’s obligations. The margin is then 
discounted using a risk-free rate.

Accounting policy for defined contribution plans 
The Group operates a contribution-based plan funded through payments to an insurance company. IBA guarantees a 
minimum return on employer contributions resulting in a financial risk to be borne by the Group. 
Following the evolution with respect of minimum guaranteed return, the plans are to be considered as defined benefit plans 
and are accounted for using the projected unit credit method. This method considers that each service period gives rise to 
an additional benefit entitlement unit.

Accounting policy for defined contribution plans 
The Group operates a contribution-based plan funded through payments to an insurance company. IBA guarantees a 
minimum return on employer contributions resulting in a financial risk to be borne by the Group. 
Following the evolution with respect of minimum guaranteed return, the plans are to be considered as defined benefit plans 
and are accounted for using the projected unit credit method. This method considers that each service period gives rise to 
an additional benefit entitlement unit. According to this method, the plans’ cost is recognized as an expense in the income 
statement so as to spread this cost evenly throughout the employee’s career, and this based on the recommendations of 
actuaries who carry out complete assessments on these retirement plans each year. 
Actuarial differences include, for assets and liabilities, differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what 
actually happened, and the impact of changes of actuarial assumptions on the plans’ liabilities. Actuarial differences are 
fully recorded in other items of the comprehensive income statement during their period of occurrence. 
Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
 
Estimating the defined benefit obligations 
To make the actuarial calculations for the valuation of defined benefit obligations, IBA needs me make assumptions for 
interest rates, future pension increases, life expectancy and employee turnover rates.

Estimating the defined benefit obligations 
To make the actuarial calculations for the valuation of defined benefit obligations, IBA needs me make assumptions for 
interest rates, future pension increases, life expectancy and employee turnover rates. The actuarial calculations are made 
by external actuaries based on inputs from observable market data, such as corporate bond returns and yield curves to 
determine the discount rates to apply, mortality tables to determine life expectancy and inflation rates to determine future 
salary and pension growth assumptions.

5.12.1 Trade payables 
As at December 31, the payment schedule for 
trade payables was as follows: 
(EUR 000) 
December 31, 2022 
December 31, 2023 
Due

Due between 4-12 months 
28 715 
36 981 
TOTAL 
65 559 
76 564 
The increase is primarily driven by an increased 
level of purchases to support the group’s 
business growth.
5.12.2 Other current and non-
current liabilities 
Advances from local governments amount to 
EUR 1.9 million as at December 31, 2023 and 
have decreased (2022: EUR 3.7 million) 
following the scheduled repayments made 
during the year. 
In 2022, the liabilities also included the refund 
liability related to the CGN contract as 
described in Note 4.3 for EUR 5.0 million. As 
the performance bond was fully released at the 
end of 2023, the amount has been recognized 
as a revenue in the year. 
The non-trade payables of EUR 9.8 million 
(2022: EUR 16.2 million) represent primarily 
VAT due in different countries where the Group 
operates. The significant decrease is driven by 
a high level of customer invoices raised at the 
end of 2022.

6. Stock options and share-based payments 
Stock option plans launched in 2014 and 2015 
have the following vesting scheme: 100 percent 
vesting as at December 31, 2018 and can be 
exercised until June 30, 2024. 
In 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, no stock option 
plan has been launched. 
The options granted under the stock option 
plans launched in 2020 vested on 2 January 
2024 and fifty percent of these options can be 
exercised until May 31, 2026 while the 
remaining fifty percent can be exercised until 
May 31, 2030. 
In January 2021, 649 972 stock options (the 
"Stock Options") were granted to members of 
the Group top management (including some 
determined persons), the “Head Plan”. Each 
Stock Option allows its beneficiary to subscribe 
to one newly issued share or receive the 
Company own shares against payment of a 
strike. The plan allows for further additional new 
persons to join the plan at a later stage; strike, 
vesting dates and expiry dates may vary. In 
2021, after the initial plan launch, 38 346 more 
options were issued followed by 16 839 in 2022 
Accounting policy for trade and other payables 
Trade and other payable are recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost. 
Accounting policy government grants 
When IBA receives government grants for specific projects, these are kept as a deferred income in the liabilities 
on the statement of financial position and IBA unwinds the income when the relevant expenses are incurred, shown net in 
the R&D expenditure line.

All transactions involving share-based payments are recognized as expenses in Other operating expenses and IBA 
constitutes a reserve for share-based payments. On vesting, exercise or forfeiture of the options, IBA does not transfer any 
amount from this reserve to other components of equity. 
Reversals of expense may however occur when vesting conditions are not met and claims are forfeited. 
Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
 
The Company used the Black & Scholes model to value options, with no vesting conditions other than time. Expected 
volatility for the stock option plans is based on historical volatility determined by statistical analysis of daily share price 
movements. The exercise price of shares for the stock option plans was based on the average share price for the 30 days 
preceding the grant date.

Classification and measurement 
Financial assets:  
The classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets are, as follows:  
Debt instruments at amortized cost: this category includes the Group’s Trade receivables, long-term receivables on 
contracts in progress, other receivables and loans included under other long-term assets, non-trade receivables/advance 
payments, short-term receivables and cash and cash equivalents. 
Equity instruments at FVOCI, with no recycling of gains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition. This category only 
includes equity instruments (other investments), which the Group intends to hold for the foreseeable future and which the 
Group has irrevocably elected to so classify upon initial recognition or transition. The Group classified its unquoted equity 
instruments as equity instruments at FVOCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment 
under IFRS 9. 
Financial assets at FVPL comprise mainly derivative instruments. 
Derivative instruments 
Derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value on the date the contracts are entered into and the group applies 
hedge accounting for some instruments that meet some criteria, such as materiality or risk. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for in the income statement unless they qualify as cash 
flow hedges.

hedge accounting for some instruments that meet some criteria, such as materiality or risk. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are accounted for in the income statement unless they qualify as cash 
flow hedges. 
The Group designates certain derivative transactions as hedges of the variability of the fair value of recognized assets or 
liabilities (fair value hedges); as unrecognized firm commitments represented by future sales; or as hedges of the cash flow 
variability arising from a specific risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or with a highly probable forecast 
transaction (cash flow hedges). 
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged 
item, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
Cash flow hedges 
Derivative financial instruments used for the protection of future cash flows are designated as hedges under cash flow hedge 
accounting.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognized in equity. Gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized immediately in the income 
statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the 
income statement (e.g., when the revenue from the forecast sale that is hedged is recognised). 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity 
and is reclassified to the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately moved to the income statement. 
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Such derivatives are recognized at fair value on the 
statement of financial position, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. 
These instruments are considered economic hedges as the Group does not hold instruments for speculative purposes. 
Financial liabilities:  
Initial recognition and measurement 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, and 
derivative financial instruments. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent measurement 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified in two categories: 
• 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: This category mainly includes derivative financial 
instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as 
defined by IFRS 9 and explained above  
• 
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings): This is the category most relevant to the Group. 
More details on this method given in Note 7.3.

7.4.1 Derivatives financial 
instruments 
Some of these financial instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments as they 
hedge specific exchange rate risks to which the 
Group is exposed. Hedge accounting has been 
applied to these contracts because they are 
deemed to be highly effective hedges. Those 
transactions are highly probable as they are 
linked to existing contracts. For these cash flow 
hedges, movements are recognized directly in 
other comprehensive income and released to 
the income statement to offset the impact of the 
underlying transactions. 
As at December 31, 2023, this is represented 
by cash flow hedges with the following 
balances: EUR 1.1 million as short-term and 
long-term financial assets (EUR -0.1 million in 
2022) and EUR -0.4 million (EUR -2.5 million in 
2022) as short-term and long-term financial 
liabilities. 
In 2023, a profit of EUR 5.1 million (2022: 
immaterial profit) was therefore recorded in 
other comprehensive income, impacting equity 
(under “Hedging Reserves in equity”) resulting 
in accumulated loss amounting to EUR 3.3 
million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: EUR 
8.4 million).

8.4 million). 
The changes of fair value of the derivatives 
which are not accounted for using hedge 
accounting are recognised in the Income 
Statement. 
As at December 31, 2023, this is represented 
by cash flow hedges with the following 
balances: EUR 0.2 million as short-term and 
long-term financial assets (EUR 0.1 million in 
2022) and EUR -0.3 million (EUR -1.6 million in 
2022) as short-term and long-term financial 
liabilities. 
In 2023, a gain of EUR 0.5 million (2022: loss of 
EUR 6.6 million) on these instruments was 
therefore recorded in the income statement. 
Hedge-accounted derivative financial 
instruments 
IBA assesses the hedge effectiveness through 
a critical terms match between the hedged item 
(future probable cash flows) and the hedging 
instrument including amount and maturity. 
Some limited ineffectiveness may however 
arise when actual timing of cash flows differs 
from the initial expectation and the hedging 
position has to be rolled-over as a result. 
As at December 31, 2023, the Group held 18 
forward 
exchange 
contracts 
(17 
as 
at 
December 31, 2022) and 9 foreign exchange 
swaps (7 as at December 31, 2022) to cover 
future cash flow movements in US dollars, 
Canadian dollars, Chinese Yuan and Korean 
Won. 
Derivative at fair value through profit or 
loss 
As at December 31, 2023, the Group holds 2 
forward exchange contracts (14 on December 
31, 2022), 6 exchange rate swaps (8 swaps as 
at December 31, 2022), to cover future cash 
flows of US dollars and Chinese Yuan.

These are investments in shares where IBA 
does not have any control nor significant 
influence. More details on these financial 
assets are to be found in Note  5.4.
 
7.5. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTISED COST
This category mainly includes cash equivalents, 
deposits, loans to customers and related parties 
as well as financial bonds that IBA subscribed 
to. More details are to be found in Note 6.2. 
Accounting policy 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
Derivatives:  
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is either the quoted market price or is calculated using pricing.

Accounting policy 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
Derivatives:  
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is either the quoted market price or is calculated using pricing. Fair values 
of hedging instruments are determined by valuation techniques widely used in financial markets  that are taking into account 
current market rates as well as the trade dates of the underlying transactions and are provided by reliable financial 
information sources. 
The fair value of these instruments generally reflects the estimated amount that IBA would receive on the settlement of 
favorable contracts or be required to pay to terminate unfavorable contracts at the financial position date, and thereby 
takes into account any unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. 
Other financial assets:  
Other financial assets at fair value are equity investments held by IBA. The fair value is determined, according to the fair 
value hierarchy described below. In case of Level 3 measurement, valuation technique usually includes a discounted cash 
flow method based on the investee’s forecasted performance. 
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement, describes 3 Levels of fair value based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. 
• 
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities. 
• 
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
• 
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques for which the lowest level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

leases for future Rights of Use assets for a total 
of EUR 6.1 million (EUR 3.9 million as at

As at December 31, 2023, IBA did not identify any contingent liabilities.

asset. The best estimate of Management for the 
insurance indemnity to be received is EUR 0.5 
million (unchanged from 2022).

EBIT 
Definition: Earning before interests and taxes 
(‘‘EBIT’’) shows the performance of the group (or 
segment) before financial income/expenses and 
taxes. It shows all operating income and 
expenses incurred during the period. 
Reason: EBIT is a useful performance indicator 
as it shows IBA’s operational performance of the 
period by eliminating the impact of the financial 
transactions and taxes.

Definition: Recurring earning before interests 
and taxes (‘‘REBIT’’) shows the result of the 
group 
(or 
segment) 
before 
financial 
income/expenses and taxes and before the 
other operating income and other operating 
expenses. REBIT is an indicator of a company's 
profitability of the ordinary activities of the group, 
adjusted with the items considered by the 
management to not be part of the underlying 
performance. 
Reason: Management considers REBIT as an 
improved performance indicator for the group

of 
the 
profitability, as cleaned up with transactions not 
considered part of the underlying performance.

Key audit matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the consolidated accounts as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
 
Revenue recognition on long-term contracts 
 
Description of the Key Audit Matter  
 
As described in Note 4.3 regarding revenue recognition, the Group applies the percentage of 
completion method to determine revenue recognition during the execution of a project. This 
percentage is determined by comparing the costs incurred to the total expected cost of the project. 
Evaluating this data requires judgment, which involves regular estimates of future costs associated 
with ongoing projects, excluding certain direct costs not related to project progress, and analyzing 
additional billing in case of variations. The Group's management relies on the knowledge of project 
managers, the granularity of its internal control system, and the experience gained from completed 
projects. 
We considered this matter to be a key audit matter due to the significance of the balances in the 
financial statements and the level of judgment involved in important assumptions. 
 
How our Audit addressed the Key Audit Matter  
 
 
We evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls related to revenue recognition 
for this type of contracts, including the estimation of costs incurred and the review of sales 
contracts.

 
We evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls related to revenue recognition 
for this type of contracts, including the estimation of costs incurred and the review of sales 
contracts. 
 
For a sample of projects, we obtained the contracts and validated the revenue characteristic 
data by reconciling them to the specific accounting module for project management. Based on 
the planned billing schedule, bank statements related to payments received during the fiscal 
year were requested and obtained through sampling. 
 
For the same sample, we also validated the estimated total costs by reconciling them to the 
tracking files and had discussions with project managers. 
 
We verified the proper allocation of costs incurred through a sample of approved invoices and 
timesheets to ensure that these costs are properly attributable to the project. 
 
We checked the correct application and consistency of the percentage of completion method as 
described in the evaluation rules. 
 
We evaluated the appropriateness and completeness of the information presented in Note 4.3 
in accordance with IFRS 15.

Based on our audit procedures, we believe that management's estimates used for revenue recognition 
are based on reasonable assumptions. The accounting policies applied are compliant in all material 
respects with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. 
 
Other matter 
 
The consolidated accounts of Ion Beam Application SA for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 
2022, have been audited by another auditor who expressed an unqualified opinion on these 
consolidated accounts in their report dated April 28, 2023.

Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated accounts 
 
The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium, and for such internal 
control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate 
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts.

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated accounts that give a true and 
fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium, and for such internal 
control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated 
accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the consolidated accounts, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate 
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Statutory auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated accounts 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts. 
 
In performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework applicable to 
the audit of the consolidated accounts in Belgium. A statutory audit does not provide any assurance as 
to the Group’s future viability nor as to the efficiency or effectiveness of the board of directors’ current 
or future business management at Group level. Our responsibilities in respect of the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting by the board of directors are described below. 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit.

• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated accounts, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control;

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors;

Conclude on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our statutory auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor’s report.

authorisation to increase the capital granted to

1.4035 corresponding to the accounting par 
applicable at the time of the issue of the warrants 
plus an issue premium of € 10.1165, which

PATENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES 
IBA is careful to patent all aspects of its 
technology for which a patent provides a 
commercial advantage. 
In addition, the Company has maintained the 
secrecy of a significant portion of its know-how 
that is not patentable or for which the Company 
believes 
secrecy 
is 
more 
effective 
than 
publication in a patent application. More 
fundamentally, the Company believes that the 
best way to protect itself from its competitors is 
not only by patenting its inventions, but by 
maintaining its technological lead. 
IBA also licenses patents from third parties and 
pays royalties to them. 
LICENSING AND COOPERATION AGREEMENTS 
IBA has licensing agreements involving various 
aspects of its technology. Listing and explaining 
the nature and terms of these licensing 
agreements falls beyond the scope of this annual 
report. These agreements cover, for example, 
certain aspects of its particle accelerator 
technology and a number of components of its 
proton therapy equipment.

Emissions (absolute and intensity) continues to increase in the context of post-covid situation, due to the plane travel part. 
- Plane related emissions increased impacted by end of Covid pandemic, though remaining 21% lower than prepandemic year 2019 per FTE (6604t 
CO2eq), thanks to alternative to flight travel such remote conferencing, remote maintenance, and more intense use of local resources. 
- The impact of the car fleet decreases slightly compared to 2022, and drops 48% lower than prepandemic year 2019 per FTE (2268t CO2eq), thanks 
to a continuous shift towards more efficient cars (hybrid/elec) within the fleet. 
In 2023, IBA continued its policy of encouraging cleaner mobility alternatives: 
- New green car policy enforcing electric vehicles only in the fleet 
- 100% reimbursement of public transportation 
- Bike commuting allowance at 0.37€/km. Bike leasing policy, with more than 274 bikes in lease by 31st December 2023 
85+% of our electricity is from renewable sources, either purchased through renewable energy credits, or autoproduced through photovoltaic 
installation at our facilities.

CO2eq), thanks to alternative to flight travel such remote conferencing, remote maintenance, and more intense use of local resources. 
- The impact of the car fleet decreases slightly compared to 2022, and drops 48% lower than prepandemic year 2019 per FTE (2268t CO2eq), thanks 
to a continuous shift towards more efficient cars (hybrid/elec) within the fleet. 
In 2023, IBA continued its policy of encouraging cleaner mobility alternatives: 
- New green car policy enforcing electric vehicles only in the fleet 
- 100% reimbursement of public transportation 
- Bike commuting allowance at 0.37€/km. Bike leasing policy, with more than 274 bikes in lease by 31st December 2023 
85+% of our electricity is from renewable sources, either purchased through renewable energy credits, or autoproduced through photovoltaic 
installation at our facilities. Related emissions are however currently included in the above figures based on average national energy mix. 
- Launch of a 500kWc solar carport installation, equipped with 50 additional EV chargers. 
Targets/goals: we have set ourselves the goal of reducing our operations’ net GHG emissions to zero by 2030. We have set ourselves the goal of 
reducing our energy intensity by 50% below 2020 levels by 2030. 
1 The 2023 reporting is based upon updated CO2 emissions factors per country in accordance to IEA 2023 guidelines. For consistency, same updated 
emission factors have been applied to the reporting of previous years based on the same guidelines.

5For the fourth consecutive year, IBA is supporting European farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture, thereby contributing to the Global 
Net Zero and financing resilience of local food systems. Through its partnership with Soil Capital, IBA supports farmers for their integration of legumes 
in their rotation, a crop which through its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, plays an essential role in emissions reduction, soil fertilization and yield 
preservation. This year, it's 21 farmers cultivating 1,128 ha of legumes and having reduced or sequestered 2,000T of CO2e who have been supported 
by IBA

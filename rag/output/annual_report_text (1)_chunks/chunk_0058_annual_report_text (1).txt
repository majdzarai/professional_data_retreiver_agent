The IBA CycloneKEY cyclotron plays an important role in 
making Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging more 
widely available worldwide by enabling the production of key 
medical isotopes used for this imaging technology. PET imaging is a highly effective medical imaging technique 
that uses radiotracers to produce detailed images of organs and 
tissues in the body.

personalized medicine in recent years, particularly in oncology, where advanced tumors can potentially be treated effectively 
with low side effects. CycloneIKON
NEW THERANOSTIC RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS
PRODUCTION SOLUTIONS
In 2021, IBA introduced its new high energy and high-capacity 
cyclotron, the CycloneIKON, which offers the largest energy 
spectrum for PET and SPECT isotopes from 13 MeV to 30 MeV. Currently, there are still a large number of patients for whom 
cancer treatment fails, despite major scientific advances. Nuclear medicine is emerging as a relevant modality to address 
this gap by extending overall survival and quality of life for 
cancer patients.

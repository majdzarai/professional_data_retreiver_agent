We have reviewed whether IBA Group still has 
control over its Russian subsidiary (Ion Beam 
Applications LLC, a 100% subsidiary of IBA 
SA). We have concluded that IBA Group still 
has control over its subsidiary based upon the 
following three aspects: IBA SA as mother company and IBA 
Groups 
management 
still 
direct 
the 
activities of the entity; IBA Russia continues to generate returns 
by continuing the maintenance activities 
that are not subject to any EU sanction; IBA SA has the power to affect these 
returns (i.e. to have a dividend paid): the 
cash flow forecast indicates an excess cash 
from 
the 
maintenance 
contract.

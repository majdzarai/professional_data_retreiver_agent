omers can rely on digital 
tools to model and optimize their product design, their future 
process, and model their centers performance from day one. As an example, IBA and TRAD, a French company specialized 
in radiation modelling, are collaborating to bring numerical 
simulation to a wide range of medical device manufacturers 
and service centers. This type of tools can potentially save 
months of product testing and tons of CO2 during production. CORPORATE BROCHURE 2024

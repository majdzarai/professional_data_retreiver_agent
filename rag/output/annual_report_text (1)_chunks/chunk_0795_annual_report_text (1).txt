------------------------------
assets: The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets. The Group recognizes a lease liability estimating the future lease payments and a corresponding right-
of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is 
available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities which could be 
following a revision of the lease term or a change in the future lease payments.

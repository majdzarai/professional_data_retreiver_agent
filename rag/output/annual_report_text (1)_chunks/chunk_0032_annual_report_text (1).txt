deploying more resources and investigating further options 
to ensure that the entire solution offered is part of a more 
eco-responsible approach. Coupled with the latest technologies in terms of green energy 
production, increased efficiency of the ionization process, recovery of fatal calories, co-generation, numerical modelling, digitalization, and product handling developed for the logistics 
industry, irradiation can be further optimized to reduce the total 
ecological footprint of the sterilization industry compared to 
other established technologies.

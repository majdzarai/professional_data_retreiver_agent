------------------------------
the introduction of eco-design practices, our product 
development processes implement the principles of circularity 
 avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle. All products from the four 
business lines, namely Proton Therapy Solutions, RadioPharma 
Solutions, Dosimetry Solutions, and Industrial Solutions are 
designed to facilitate maintenance and servicing. A circular 
process to return defective or surplus parts deployed to our 
customers is now in place, for repair, resale or recycling.

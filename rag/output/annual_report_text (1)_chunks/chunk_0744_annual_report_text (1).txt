------------------------------
Interest paid on debt decrease due to an early 
repayment of the term loan in 2022 as well as the 
interest rate renegotiated with the main creditors 
in August 2022. The 
impact 
of 
hyperinflation 
represents 
primarely the revaluation of non-monetary items 
following the application of IAS 29 on the 
Argentinian subsidiary. Most of the impact is 
derived from the revaluation of the contract 
liability position on the installation contract which 
started early 2023. The increase in the argentinian official index in 
2023 was 211%.

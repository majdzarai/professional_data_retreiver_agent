------------------------------
mmencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease 
payments to be made over the lease term. Some leases have variable lease payments that depend on an index in which case 
an initial estimation is prepared using the local relevant index; when the actual indexe is known, the future cash flows are 
reassessed and the lease liabilities are adjusted with the corresponding Right of Use asset. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

er concentration in the 
Belgian market allows this process to be 
centralized with a limited number of people, with 
the CFO playing a leading role. A schedule 
summarizing the periodic requirements for the 
communication 
of 
financial 
information 
is 
available at the Group level, with details of the 
nature and date of each requirement. A 
procedure stipulates the persons responsible for 
preparing, approving, and communicating this 
financial information to the market, based on 
whether the information is restricted or not, and 
commercial or financial in nature.

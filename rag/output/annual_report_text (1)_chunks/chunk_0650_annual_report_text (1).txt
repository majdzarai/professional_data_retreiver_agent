n-financial 
assets. Goodwill impairment test: the 5-year strategic 
plan used as a basis for the impairment test was 
prepared in December 2023 using the latest 
inflation forecasts taking into account energy 
and transport prices increases, as well as a 
higher discount rate. Despite these prudent 
inputs, the group has sufficient headroom in the 
impairment test to conclude that the risk is 
relatively low. The conflict was assessed as having little 
impact on IBAs global supply chain; the high 
energy prices and other materials costs were 
considered when applying inflation in the 
strategic forecasts of the group.

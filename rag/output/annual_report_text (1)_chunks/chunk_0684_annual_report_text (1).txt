------------------------------
t is common to have an element of variable consideration such as an earn out which is contingent to the 
future performance of the acquired business. IBA makes an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration at the 
acquisition date; subsequent changes to the fair value that is deemed to be an asset or liability, are recognized in profit or 
loss. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and presented under Other Operating expenses. Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest 
over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

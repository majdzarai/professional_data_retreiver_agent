Campus, the most knowledgeable proton therapy community
WHAT IS CAMPUS? IBA is fully committed to Proton Therapy for more than 
30 years. The Company has come a long way to get where 
it is today: at the top of the proton therapy market. Yet, IBA could never have achieved this on its own. Everything it has accomplished is the result of the strong 
relationships it has built with its unique community. Because 
turning the world into one that is cancer-free requires a great 
deal of collaboration, knowledge sharing and joint research. Campus aims to bring this collaboration to the next level.

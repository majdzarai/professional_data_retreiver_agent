n equipment with a streamlined 
production process of 13N-ammonia, one of the most 
recognized radiotracers in cardiac imaging institutes 
worldwide. The system is a single button solution making it 
a convenient and efficient tool for on-demand production. It is designed to be operated by a trained technologist, with a 
ready-to-use ammonia dose produced approximately every 
ten minutes, resulting in a higher daily patient throughput and 
a better return-on-investment. Cardiac PET imaging can be very useful 
for the management of many patients 
with suspected or known heart disease.

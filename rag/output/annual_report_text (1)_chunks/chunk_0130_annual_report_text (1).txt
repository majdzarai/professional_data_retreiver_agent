SHARING PROFITS
Our profit-sharing plan assigned to each employee matches 
the dividend paid to shareholders. This aligns shareholders and 
employees interests with a proper balance between short-term 
performance and long-term goals in support of the realization 
of IBAs strategic commitment to its stakeholder approach. OFFERING FLEXIBLE BENEFITS
We believe in flexibility. In selected countries, the new 
MyChoice plan is designed to better align the individual value 
of a salary benefit with the individual needs of IBA employees.

oard of directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our statutory auditors report to the related disclosures in the consolidated accounts 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditors report.

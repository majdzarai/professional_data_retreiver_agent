Accounting policy for defined contribution plans 
The Group operates a contribution-based plan funded through payments to an insurance company. IBA guarantees a 
minimum return on employer contributions resulting in a financial risk to be borne by the Group. Following the evolution with respect of minimum guaranteed return, the plans are to be considered as defined benefit plans 
and are accounted for using the projected unit credit method. This method considers that each service period gives rise to 
an additional benefit entitlement unit.

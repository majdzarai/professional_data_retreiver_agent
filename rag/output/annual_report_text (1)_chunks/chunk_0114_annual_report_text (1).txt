ilable resources. myQA PROactive workflow
Watch the video. myQA iON provides high level 
of automation and an easy 
overview of all patient QA tasks. We added some scripts to our TPS 
to automatically send the DICOM 
data to myQA iON as soon as a plan 
is approved. myQA iON calculates 
the dose and evaluates the data 
during the preparation work inside 
the OIS automatically; this speeds 
up our QA. When we finish prep, the QA is ready. The Monte Carlo 
algorithm provides high specificity 
and sensitivity to capture real 
clinical errors. myQA iONs accuracy 
and performance give us high 
confidence in our patient QA 
processes.

------------------------------
The variable compensation paid in 2023 
relates to 2022 performance year. The plan 
was based on business results vs pre-
defined goals which were measured for 33% 
against Profit Before Tax (PBT), for 33% 
against Order Intake and for 34% on 
Sustainability. The choice of these performance criteria 
contributes to the long term development of 
the company, being a mix of current financial 
performance (backlog conversion), new 
business 
(backlog 
creation) 
and 
stakeholders impact (sustainability). In order to protect its competitive 
position, IBA does not disclose targets. Each criteria is assessed separately 
against 
pre-approved 
targets.

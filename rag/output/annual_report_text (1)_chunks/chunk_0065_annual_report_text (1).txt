PET Cardiology Diagnostic 
A PREFERRED MODALITY FOR 
CARDIAC IMAGING
In cardiology, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of the 
heart is a non-invasive nuclear imaging test using radioactive 
tracers. It is used to diagnose coronary artery disease and 
damage following a heart attack. PET scans are also used to 
define the best therapy treatment. In 2023, IBA launched AKURACY, a fully integrated solution 
that combines PET production equipment with a streamlined 
production process of 13N-ammonia, one of the most 
recognized radiotracers in cardiac imaging institutes 
worldwide.

s for EUR 53.8 million, Sales and Marketing expenses for EUR 26.3 
million and Research and Development net of 
research credit for EUR 47.9 million. Despite 
efficient control of overhead costs, careful

demonstrates the strategic efforts that IBA is 
making on both operating segments to maintain 
its technological leadership in all business lines.

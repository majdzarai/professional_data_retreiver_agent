he acquisition is 
anticipated to be revenue accretive and EBIT 
positive from 2024 onwards and will further 
strengthen Dosimetrys product offering. This 
acquisition, combined with that of Modus QA in 
Canada in 2022 as well as organic growth, has 
doubled IBA Dosimetrys footprint in North 
America, both in terms of staff and revenues. Dosimetry continues to work towards offering its 
customers a fully end to end solution, that may 
be supported by further strategic acquisitions 
and a stronger presence in key geographical 
areas like India and China.

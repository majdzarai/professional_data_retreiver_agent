explanation for such a deviation is that IBA has 
a particular shareholder structure to preserve 
and secure its anchorage in Belgium. Therefore, there is no majority of independent directors in 
the Nomination Committee. IBA also reports that it deviates from principle 7.6

Code, which states that [a] non-executive board 
member

part

their 
remuneration in the form of shares in the 
company (.). National law applicable to some 
non-executive directors of IBA prohibits them 
from receiving part of their remuneration in the 
form of shares of the company.

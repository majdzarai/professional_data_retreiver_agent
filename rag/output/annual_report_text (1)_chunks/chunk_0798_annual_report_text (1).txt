Source of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
Lease term: The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an 
option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the 
lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Group applies judgement in 
evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease.

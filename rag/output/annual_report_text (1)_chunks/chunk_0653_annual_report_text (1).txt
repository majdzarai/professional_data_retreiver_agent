Climate related matters are managed by the 
Sustainability Board which meets once a year 
and decides on the Groups commitments and 
action plans. Three risks categories have been 
identified being strategic risks, process and 
operational risks and product risks; all are 
monitored closely by Management. The risk 
assessment is done once a year and each risk 
is managed internally with a defined process 
which covers the risk identification, the risk 
analysis and scoring, the risk strategy, risk 
mitigation and closure as well as the review and 
monitoring.

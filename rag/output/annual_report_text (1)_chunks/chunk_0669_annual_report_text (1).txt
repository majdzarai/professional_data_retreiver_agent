tion 
contract 
as 
well 
as 
operation 
and 
maintenance contrat have been reviewed 
with the latest price increases and expected 
future inflation. Pension plan provision: inflation was also 
factored in the actuarial assumptions used 
for the calculation of the provision for the 
defined benefit pension plan, although only 
the long-term inflation is relevant for these 
calculations. Expected credit losses on loans and 
receivables: the amount and timing of the 
expected credit losses, as well as the 
probability assigned thereto, has been 
based on the available information at the 
end of year 2023, including a consideration 
on the impact of inflation on our customers.

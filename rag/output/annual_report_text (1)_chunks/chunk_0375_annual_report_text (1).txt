IBA Annual Report 2023 
73. IBA 
Remuneration 
Policy: Non-
Managing Directors 
In accordance with IBAs Corporate Governance 
Charter, published on the group website, the 
Board of Directors determines the remuneration 
policy and amounts paid to non-Managing 
Directors, based on recommendations made by 
the Compensation Committee. It is reviewed 
regularly in the light of market practice. IBA directors are currently remunerated by an 
annual lump-sum fee of EUR 6,000, except 
directors residing overseas, who, in order to 
cover the specific time implications and 
constraints related to intercontinental travel, receive EUR 16,000.

ceivables 
Long-term receivables amounted to EUR 21.1 
million at end of 2023, a small decrease when 
compared to the end of 2022 (EUR 21.4 million). The decrease of EUR -0.3 million is mainly due 
to a decrease of miscellaneous long-term 
receivables for an amount of EUR -1.2 million, which includes a long-term receivable on a 
Proton Therapy Centre in Italy as well as the 
long-term portion of a commercial receivable on 
a Chinese customer, compensated by a higher 
receivable (increase with EUR 1.1 million) of a 
tax 
credit 
received 
for 
Research 
and 
Development activities (CIRD). Given these 
R&D activities increased compared to last year, the tax credit also increased.

numerous advantages:. Potentially enhanced dose conformity at the tumor level and 
a potential reduction of the total dose received by the patient2.. Simplified treatment planning and delivery without performing 
multiple field adjustments.. Less time in the treatment room and a maximized patient 
throughput thanks to an optimized workflow3. Today, the IBA Proteus system is the only PT system meeting all 
the needs in terms of beam characteristics for DynamicARC: fast energy-layer switching time, intrinsic small beam, fast 
scanning, and the ability to modulate dose rate within a layer. Watch the video: Shaping the future 
of proton therapy.

As at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there are no contract assets set as a 
warranty to cover the financing of a proton 
therapy contract. As at December 31, 2023, contracts in progress 
and amounts due to customers for contract 
assets showed a net position of EUR -245.0 
million compared to EUR -256.8 million as at 
December 31, 2022. The decrease of EUR 11.8 
million is primarily explained by the progress 
made on some customer sites, despite the level 
of billings remaining high in 2023.

SCK-CEN 
(Belgian Nuclear Research Center). Both 
entities participate for 50% of the share capital 
with an initial contribution of EUR 0.3 million. The JV is established in Belgium and will be 
active in the nuclear medicine, more specifically 
it will develop, produce and distribute the 
isotope Ac.225. The R&D project is still at a 
very early stage but the JV has secured some 
early supply of Ac.225 via a partnership with 
TerraPower Isotopes. In 2023, both IBA and SCK-CEN made further 
equal contributions to the capital of PanTera 
SA/NV. IBA contributed EUR 16.0 million in 
cash which has been used immediately by 
Pantera to purchase a Rhodotron from IBA.

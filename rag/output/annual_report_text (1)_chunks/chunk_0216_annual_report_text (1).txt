IBA RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Risk management is a core component of the 
IBA strategy and performance management 
process. The Board of Directors considers risk 
appetite when making decisions. The design and effectiveness of IBAs risk 
management, practices, and 
the 
recommendations from internal and external 
audits are reported and discussed periodically 
with the Risk Management Committee.

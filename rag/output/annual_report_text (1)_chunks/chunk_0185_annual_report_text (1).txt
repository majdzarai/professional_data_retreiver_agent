Continued good progress of IBA and SCK 
CENs joint venture PanTera for the 
production 
of 
actinium-225, with 
collaborations 
secured

financial results are as follows: Total 2023 Group revenues of EUR 428.7 
million, up 18.7% versus last year, in line 
with expectations and driven by accelerated 
backlog conversion in H2 across all 
business units, with particularly strong 
growth from Proton Therapy (PT) Services, Dosimetry and Other Accelerators

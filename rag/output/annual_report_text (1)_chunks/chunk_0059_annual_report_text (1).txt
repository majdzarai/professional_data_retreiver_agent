y. PET imaging is a highly effective medical imaging technique 
that uses radiotracers to produce detailed images of organs and 
tissues in the body. It is used in the diagnosis and treatment of a 
wide range of medical conditions, including cancer, neurological 
disorders, and cardiovascular disease. CycloneKEY is giving the opportunity 
to anyone, anywhere in the word to get 
access to PET cyclotron technology 
and PET imaging. Its also very interesting for inhouse 
production because the local hospital 
will not depend on the big suppliers 
of radio-pharmaceuticals.

BLE AND RESILIENT 
BUSINESS MODEL
In todays global and increasingly volatile economy, we 
have demonstrated flexibility, adaptability and resilience. These are fundamental to the continued success 
of our business activities. We continue to focus on quality and innovation 
and, thanks to excellent sales in our businesses 
(Proton Therapy, Dosimetry, Industrial Solutions 
and RadioPharma Solutions), we are managing an 
increasingly larger installed base and are, as a result, focusing more on service and upgrades.

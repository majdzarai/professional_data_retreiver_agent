business combinations 
Business combinations: All business combinations (acquisitions of businesses) are accounted for using the acquisition method. During the purchase 
price allocation process, IBA determines the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets, liabilities, and contingent 
liabilities and allocates the consideration to these. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is measured at fair value and includes any contingent 
consideration. It is common to have an element of variable consideration such as an earn out which is contingent to the 
future performance of the acquired business.

IBA Annual Report 2023 
55. IBA 
maintains insurance to protect itself in the event 
of damages arising from a product liability 
lawsuit or from the use of its products. In a 
country such as the United States, where the 
slightest incident may result in major lawsuits, there is always a risk that a patient who is 
dissatisfied with services received by products 
delivered by IBA may initiate legal action against 
it. The Company cannot guarantee that its 
insurance coverage will always be sufficient to 
protect it from such risks or that it will always be 
possible to obtain coverage for such risks.

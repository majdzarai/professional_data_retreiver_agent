In establishing the remuneration policy, the 
Board of Directors has considered the external 
environment in which IBA operates, legal 
requirements and principles of the Belgian 
Corporate Governance Code 2020, market 
practice and guidance issued by organizations 
representing institutional shareholders. After review by the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determines the direct or 
indirect remuneration paid to the Managing 
Directors in accordance with its remuneration 
policy. The 
Committee 
ensures 
that 
remuneration is in line with market practice, as 
determined by studies performed by specialized 
firms.

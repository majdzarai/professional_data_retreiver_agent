------------------------------
testing the goodwill 
recognised on business combinations annually for impairment, after the latest strategic plan has been approved by 
Management. All other assets are depreciated or amortised and are tested for impairment only if there is an indicator that an asset is 
impaired; management monitors closely the past and future performance of each segment as well as other internal and 
external factors through regular meetings, performance reviews, discussions with third parties and other stakeholders. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated among the Groups cash-generating units (CGU) that are 
expected to benefit from synergies as a result of the business combination.

on Committee fully 
acknowledge the benefits of diversity among 
employees, within the Executive Management 
Team, and within the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2023, more than one third 
of the directors are of the other gender which 
means 
that 
the 
Company 
meets 
the 
requirements on gender diversity. The age distribution within the management 
team is quite broad, indicating a fair and 
balanced 
value 
between 
said 
members. Management approved the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion Policy on 15 and 16 December 2021, and requests the Management to implement this 
policy to the fullest extent.

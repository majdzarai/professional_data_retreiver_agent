discussion include market 
situation, strategy, technological developments, financial 
developments, human 
resources 
management and sustainability. Reports on topics dealt with at Board meetings 
are sent to the directors beforehand so that they 
can exercise their duties with full knowledge of 
the facts. During the financial year 2023, the Board of 
Directors met 5 times on the occasion of regular 
board meetings - under the chairmanship of Mr. Pierre Mottet -, once for the Sustainability Board 
meeting, and once for the Product Committee 
meeting. Attendance at meetings of the Board 
was very high. A large majority of the directors 
attended all meetings.

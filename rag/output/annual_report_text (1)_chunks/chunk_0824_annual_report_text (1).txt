ociates and Joint Ventures 
An associate is an entity in which IBA has significant influence, but which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint 
venture. Joint ventures (JVs) are the arrangements in which IBA has joint control. Associates and JVs are accounted for 
using the equity method. When IBAs share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture, the 
carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that IBA has 
committed to further contributions to that associate or JV. === Page 150 ===

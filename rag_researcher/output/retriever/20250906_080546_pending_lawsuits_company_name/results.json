It involves \nthe use of radiopharmaceuticals, which are compounds that \ncontain both a radioactive isotope and a targeting molecule. These radiopharmaceuticals are injected into the patients \nbloodstream and travel to cancer cells, where they can be \ndetected using imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT. Once the cancer cells have been identified, the same \nradiopharmaceutical can be used to deliver a targeted dose \nof radiation to the cancer cells, killing them while sparing \nhealthy tissues.",

o, the Groups 
exposure to foreign currencies is related 
primarily to the US dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian 
rupee, Russian ruble and Canadian dollar. In 
particular, the US dollar and the Chinese yuan 
are considered as material for the Group. The Groups general policy is to hedge sales 
contracts denominated in a foreign currency as 
well as expected net operational cash flows 
when they can reasonably be predicted. To this 
effect, provided there is no natural hedging 
opportunity, the Group Treasury uses financial 
instruments to hedge its net exposure to these 
risks, including forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, and forex options.

ustainability approach. We 
value the uniqueness. We define Diversity not only as statistics, but as 
the accumulated richness of peoples unique 
backgrounds, lives, cultural experiences, and 
the diversity of thought and ways of acting that 
this brings to our workplace. We foster Inclusion by respecting individual 
differences and capturing the advantages that 
this provides to drive greater impact and value in 
our work. We call it the IBA culture, in which we 
create an environment that helps each and every 
one of us to fully contribute to IBAs success.

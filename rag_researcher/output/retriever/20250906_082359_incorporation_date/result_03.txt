. Subject to these factors, we confirm our expectation that the annual 
revenue growth rate should reach an average of 15% over the 2022-2026 period. We project a recurring earnings before interest and taxes (REBIT) equivalent to about 
10% of total sales by 2026, progressively delivered and weighted after 2024, as current 
macroeconomic effects fade and operational leverage accelerates with volume. Finally, we expect capital expenditures (CAPEX) of EUR 10 to 12 million per year until 2026 
to support infrastructure development, innovation, sustainability, and digitization, to maintain IBAs cutting-edge offer and foster its future growth.

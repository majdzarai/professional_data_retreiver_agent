AN EVEN FASTER GROWTH 
IN AMERICA AND ASIA
Until recently, reference sites for X-ray and electron beam 
industrial sterilization were mostly concentrated in central 
Europe. Today, IBA Industrial sees a strong deployment of the 
technology in all regions of the world, with remarkable activity 
in the United States, Southeast Asia and China. IBA is currently 
deploying a stronger regionalization plan in those areas where it 
is already present, including adding resources for installations 
and services, hubs for parts logistics, and third-party suppliers.

Protection and restoration of 
biodiversity and ecosystems 
Activities covered by the taxonomy are referred 
to as taxonomy-eligible activities. For these 
activities, the delegated acts that complete the 
taxonomy define performance criteria for the 
environmental objectives, as well as minimum 
safeguards for the protection of human rights 
and labor law. An activity is considered 
taxonomy-aligned if it makes a substantial 
contribution to one or more objectives, without 
significantly undermining the other objectives, and if it also complies with the defined minimum 
safeguards. Different means may be required for an activity 
to make a substantial contribution to each 
objective.

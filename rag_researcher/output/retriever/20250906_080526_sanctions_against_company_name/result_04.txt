A COMBINATION OF DIAGNOSIS AND 
THERAPY: THERANOSTICS
Radiotheranostics is a type of cancer treatment that combines 
diagnostic imaging with targeted radiation therapy. It involves 
the use of radiopharmaceuticals, which are compounds that 
contain both a radioactive isotope and a targeting molecule. These radiopharmaceuticals are injected into the patients 
bloodstream and travel to cancer cells, where they can be 
detected using imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT. Once the cancer cells have been identified, the same 
radiopharmaceutical can be used to deliver a targeted dose 
of radiation to the cancer cells, killing them while sparing 
healthy tissues.

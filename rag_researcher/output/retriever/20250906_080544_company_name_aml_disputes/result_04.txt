Onerous contracts for services: The Group recognises a provision of onerous contract when the unavoidable costs of fullfilling the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received. This is the case when a service contract is expected to generate negative margin 
in the remaining years. For each contract presenting a risk, the expected margin for the remaining years of the initial term 
is calculated based on the latest available reforecast of the future costs to complete IBAs obligations.

Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, focusing on the development 
and commercialization of radiopharmaceuticals for cancer 
diagnosis and therapy. One of its key areas of research is the use 
of actinium-225, a radioactive isotope that has shown promise 
in the treatment of several types of cancer. Actinium-225 emits 
alpha particles, which are highly effective at killing cancer cells 
while sparing healthy tissues. PanTera is working on developing 
actinium-225-based radiopharmaceuticals to treat a variety 
of cancers, including prostate cancer and multiple myeloma.

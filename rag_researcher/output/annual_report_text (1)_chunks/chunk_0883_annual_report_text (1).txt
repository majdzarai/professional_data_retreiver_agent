Work in progress relates to the production of 
inventory for which a customer has not yet been 
secured, while contracts assets (note 4.3.1) 
relate to the production for specific customers in 
fulfilling obligations under a signed contract. The inventories have significantly increased in 
2023. This is driven by an increase in customer 
orders, business growth and anticipation of 
production planning requirements.

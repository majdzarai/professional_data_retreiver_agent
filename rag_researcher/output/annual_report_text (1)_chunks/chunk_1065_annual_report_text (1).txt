Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists.

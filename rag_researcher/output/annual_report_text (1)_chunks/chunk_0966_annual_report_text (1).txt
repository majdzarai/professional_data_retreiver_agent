Accounting policy for share-based transactions 
Share-based payments are transactions to be paid with shares, stock options, or other equity instruments (granted to 
employees). These plans often include certain vesting conditions such as continuous employment for a period of time. As 
the fair value of goods or services received in exchange for the employee options cannot be determined, the Group uses the 
fair value of the equity instruments granted. === Page 164 ===

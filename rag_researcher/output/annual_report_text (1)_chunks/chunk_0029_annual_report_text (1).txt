Industrial 
solutions
These solutions allow in-house customers 
or contract sterilizers to sterilize medical devices 
either by E-beam in boxes or X-ray in pallets, or both. They also offer an environmentally-friendly 
and readily available alternative to toxic chemicals 
such as ethylene oxide and nuclear materials such 
as cobalt 60. Because it is ingrained in its DNA and because medical 
device sterilization is already well-established, IBA 
leverages its technological expertise to disrupt 
other key applications such as food irradiation 
and environmental applications.

This Code is the object of a specific training with 
a quiz with a required 80% succes rate for 
passing, mandatory for all IBA employees, trainees, interim personnel and a selection of 
consultants. The purpose of this training is to 
remind employees of the fundamental principles 
contained in the Code, which we apply every day 
at IBA throughout all businesses and across the 
globe. It also aims at informing employees of the 
different options to report non-compliance with 
the Code.

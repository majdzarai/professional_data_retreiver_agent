urrency, which is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which they operate and 
corresponds for most of them to their local 
currency. All monetary and non-monetary assets and 
liabilities (including goodwill) are translated to 
euros at the closing rate. Income and expenses 
are translated at the average rate for the month, except 
for 
foreign 
operations 
in 
hyperinflationary 
economies 
which 
are 
translated at the closing rate of the year. Differences arising from translation at these 
different rates are recognized directly in equity 
under Currency translation difference and 
have no impact on the Income Statement.

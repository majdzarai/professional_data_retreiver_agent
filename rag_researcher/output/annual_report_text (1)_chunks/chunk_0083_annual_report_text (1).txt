One of the initiatives IBA Proton Therapy is currently 
supporting is the PROTECTTrial. The PROTECT Trial 
is a large-scale, multi-institutional, randomized 
controlled clinical trial in conjunction with 19 industry 
and academic partners. The consortium conducts 
trials in esophageal cancer with the aim of improving 
access to proton therapy for patients, whilst validating 
a model-based approach for the use of proton therapy 
treatment in cancer more broadly.

t are leased by IBA. The acquisition cost only included 
third party invoices which were directly attributable to the work performed on these assets. Internal resources are usually 
not capitalised unless it can be demonstrated that these are directly attributable to the asset being constructed and these 
can be measured. In addition, no borrowing costs have been capitalised. Each asset is depreciated over its useful life using the straight-line method; assets are not revalued. Leased assets: The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets.

------------------------------
gh value backlog conversion. 26 installations 
began in 2023, with 16 of them starting in the 
second half. 17 installations were completed in 
2023. Services had a strong year, increasing by 
33.7% compared to 2022 as the installed base 
grew and the Industrial business in particular 
started to implement a targeted service strategy. Industrial Solutions revenues increased 110% 
compared to 2022, driven by growing equipment 
and services contracts. Order intake was slower 
than the previous year, with impacts still felt from 
post-COVID overstocking of medical equipment, leading to lower demand for sterilization 
services.

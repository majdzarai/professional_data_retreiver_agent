the proton 
Bragg peak.. Dose delivery in 1-2 beams, with no need for multi-field 
delivery, dose-splitting and potentially losing the FLASH effect.. Improved conformality due to reduced entrance and exit dose.. 3-4 times more patients in ConformalFLASH than shoot-
through FLASH, through more eligible indications like 
abdominal cancers4. As the industry leader, IBA is collaborating with several leading 
proton therapy centers in their pioneering research work 
to better understand the mechanisms of FLASH irradiation. DYNAMICARC1
IBA is developing a novel proton therapy delivery technique 
called DynamicARC.

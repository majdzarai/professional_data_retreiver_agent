PanTera SA/NV 
In 2022, IBA established a strategic R&D 
partnership as a Joint Venture with SCK-CEN 
(Belgian Nuclear Research Center). Both 
entities participate for 50% of the share capital 
with an initial contribution of EUR 0.3 million. The JV is established in Belgium and will be 
active in nuclear medicine, more specifically it 
will develop, produce and distribute the isotope 
Ac-225. The project is still at a very early stage 
and is expected to start small quantities of early 
supply from 2024 and large quantities of 
commercial production from 2028.

BIODIVERSITY
IBA also has an impact on biodiversity:. A direct impact through our operations: offices and manu-
facturing facilities.. An indirect impact through the waste generated by our 
operations indirect impact through the waste generated by 
our operations. In partnership with Natagora, we have set targets for labelling 
our main facilities Reseau Nature Entreprise. This aims to 
develop biodiversity in our workplace by taking actions that 
benefit nature. Various measures have been implemented 
to support biodiversity, such as green roofs, planting native 
species and differential mowing to reduce our ecological 
footprint.

In July 2023, IBA contributed intellectual 
property to its Joint Venture Pantera which was 
valued at EUR 4.4 million. The IP was not 
valued in IBAs balance sheet and the gain on 
the contribution was recognised in the entity's 
financial statements only to the extent of the 
other investor's interests in the Joint Venture 
(50%). to recognize the full revenue of the license, given the level of uncertainty linked to this type of sale (unique in its kind for 
IBA).

------------------------------
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated accounts as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated accounts.

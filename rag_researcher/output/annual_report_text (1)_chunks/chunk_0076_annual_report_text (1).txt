radioligand therapy. To enable this revolution, we must enhance the availability of 
novel isotopes and boost their production capacity. The cyclotron 
must play its part as a reliable and sustainable production 
source of isotopes for the radiopharmaceutical industry. This is particularly the case for Germanium-68 (used for 
Germanium-68/Gallium-68 generators), Iodine-123 and other 
radioisotopes such as Copper-64, for which the demand has 
been consistently expanding year after year. Watch the video: IBA new CycloneIKON. IBA has been a trusted partner

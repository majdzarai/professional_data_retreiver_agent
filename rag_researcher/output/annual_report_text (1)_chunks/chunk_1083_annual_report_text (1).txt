Our registered audit firm and our network did not provide services which are incompatible with the 
statutory audit of the consolidated accounts, and our registered audit firm remained independent 
of the Group in the course of our mandate. The fees for additional services which are compatible with the statutory audit of the consolidated 
accounts referred to in article 3:65 of the Companies' and Associations' Code are correctly 
disclosed and itemized in the notes to the consolidated accounts.

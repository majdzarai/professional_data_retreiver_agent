IBA Annual Report 2023 
55. IBA 
maintains insurance to protect itself in the event 
of damages arising from a product liability 
lawsuit or from the use of its products. In a 
country such as the United States, where the 
slightest incident may result in major lawsuits, there is always a risk that a patient who is 
dissatisfied with services received by products 
delivered by IBA may initiate legal action against 
it.

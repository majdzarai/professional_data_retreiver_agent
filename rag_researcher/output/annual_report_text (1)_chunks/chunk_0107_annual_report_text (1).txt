on therapy delivery technique 
called DynamicARC. This technique allows dynamic spot-
scanning irradiation and energy switching while the gantry 
is rotating. It offers the advantages of Pencil Beam Scanning 
(PBS), the advanced characteristic of the Bragg peak with 
no exit dose, and the conformal delivery. Proton arc therapy has the possibility to further improve 
the quality of treatment. This technological evolution will 
offer patients numerous advantages:. Potentially enhanced dose conformity at the tumor level and 
a potential reduction of the total dose received by the patient2..

------------------------------
The legal landscape is still evolving and what is 
presented today is a snapshot of the current 
status. With respect to taxonomy, what must be 
examined is 6 criteria versus IBAs activities. If 
within scope, then compliance is reported. Today, IBA revenues do not fall within scope, while some capital and operational expenditures 
do. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a 
non-financial reporting tool on a voluntary basis, but which could become part of the mandatory 
reporting obligations in the future. For 2023, no 
changes are expected.

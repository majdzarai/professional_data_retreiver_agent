IBA sold the first Cyclone KEY, launched
to 
enable 
small 
and 
medium-sized
hospitals 
to 
produce 
their 
own
radiopharmaceutical products in-house, for
installation at a hospital in Benin. IBA 
acquired 
a 
US-based 
Radcal
Corporation, a pioneer in X-ray imaging
quality assurance. The acquisition is
anticipated to be revenue accretive and 
EBIT positive from 2024 onwards, and will 
further strengthen IBA Dosimetrys product 
offering.

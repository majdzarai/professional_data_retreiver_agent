The Corporate Governance Charter, published 
on the Groups website, defines the core 
competencies the Board of Directors requires to 
be effective. Members are nominated based on 
the Boards needs in terms of knowledge, experience, and competence at that time, also 
respecting the balance between outside, inside 
and other Directors laid down in the Articles of 
Association, the law, and the 2020 Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board and the Nomination Committee fully 
acknowledge the benefits of diversity among 
employees, within the Executive Management 
Team, and within the Board of Directors.

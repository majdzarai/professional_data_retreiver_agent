milestones on IBAs ESG goals. The Managing Directors are not present at the 
Board and Compensation Committee meetings 
where their performance and variable payout 
levels are discussed and decided. Profit Sharing Plan 
IBAs multi-stakeholders approach includes a 
profit-sharing plan to materialize alignment 
between 
employees 
and 
shareholders 
interests. The payment of a dividend triggers a 
profit-sharing plan resulting in a common view of 
success. IBAs commitment is to distribute the 
same amount to its employees as the total 
dividend paid to its shareholders.

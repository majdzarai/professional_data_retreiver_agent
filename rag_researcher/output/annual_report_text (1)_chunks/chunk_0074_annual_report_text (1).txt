ed using imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT. Once the cancer cells have been identified, the same 
radiopharmaceutical can be used to deliver a targeted dose 
of radiation to the cancer cells, killing them while sparing 
healthy tissues. Radiotheranostics is a promising approach to cancer care 
because it allows for the personalized treatment of individual 
patients based on the specific characteristics of their cancer 
cells. This means that patients may experience fewer side 
effects and better treatment outcomes compared to traditional 
cancer treatments.

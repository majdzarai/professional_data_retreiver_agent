Liabilities arising 
from a Single Transaction 
In May 2021, the Board issued amendments to 
IAS 12, which narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under IAS 12, so that it no 
longer applies to transactions that give rise to 
equal 
taxable 
and 
deductible 
temporary 
differences. The amendments have been applied to 
transactions that occur on or after January 1, 2023 with no material impacts on both the 
current period and the previous periods 
presented as comparatives.

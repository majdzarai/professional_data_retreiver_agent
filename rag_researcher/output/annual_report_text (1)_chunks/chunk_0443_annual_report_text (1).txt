h, IBA, including its employees and 
representatives, must not accept, neither 
directly, nor through any family member or 
anyone else, gifts or favours of any kind from a 
business partner, or offer the same to the latter, or to any public official, except if they are 
courtesy gifts, considered as modest in value 
and to the extent that the time and place is 
appropriate. In any case, such favours are prohibited if they 
may affect or even appear to affect the integrity 
or independence of the business partner, the

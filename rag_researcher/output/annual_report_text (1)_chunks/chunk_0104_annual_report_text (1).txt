CONFORMALFLASH1: FLASH is a key research area that may dramatically improve 
the clinical relevance of proton therapy for patients around 
the world. IBA is uniquely positioned to drive the development 
of FLASH irradiation2-3, the next major innovation expected 
in radiation therapy. IBA is investing heavily in developing a novel technique 
using the Bragg peak called ConformalFLASH.

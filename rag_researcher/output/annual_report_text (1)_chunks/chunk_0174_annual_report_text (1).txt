materiality assessment 
based on a dialogue with its stakeholders and the 
reference framework recommended by the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI). It is in this broad area that we are concentrating our efforts, with the hierarchy of our priorities obtained by aligning the 
concerns of the company (outside in view) with the interests 
of our stakeholders (inside-out view). This results in a materiality matrix that takes into account data 
from the ongoing dialogue that IBA has established with all 
its stakeholders, through formal and informal exchanges 
and from publications on environmental issues.

This report on the FY 2023 has been drafted 
pursuant to sections 3:23 and 3:32, 1, in fine, of 
the Belgian Companies and Associations Code 
(hereafter the BCAC), which allow to combine 
the management report on the annual accounts 
of the Company (rapport de gestion sur les 
comptes annuels) with the management report 
on the group consolidated annual accounts 
(rapport de gestion sur les comptes consolides). Hence, the present report is a consolidated and 
integrated report.

An internal procedure is in place to document the responsibilities and requirements for identifying environmental, health and safety hazards of the 
organizations activities, products or services, and for evaluating and controlling the associated risks and impacts. This management tool is used to 
assess environmental, health and safety risks and impacts. It also records the actions and control measures deployed by our various entities in the 
context of their continuous improvement process.

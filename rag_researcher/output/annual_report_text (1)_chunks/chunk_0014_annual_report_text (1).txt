IBA completed its B Corp 
recertification in april 2024 with a score of 114 points, making a significant progress 
along our sustainability journey. In early 2024, IBA also launched Oncia Community, a public utility foundation focused on supporting access to holistic cancer care, alongside high-quality cancer treatments. The foundation has been established 
with the support of industrial partners and various European cancer care centers. Looking ahead, IBA remains focused on keeping its supply chain moving and accelerating 
backlog conversion. Alongside this, investment is important for the business and will 
be executed with an agile and targeted approach.

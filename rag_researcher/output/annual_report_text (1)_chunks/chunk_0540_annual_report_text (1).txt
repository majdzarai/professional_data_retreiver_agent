fixed assets 
Financial fixed assets amount to EUR 160.4 
million in 2023 compared to EUR 139.0 million in 
2022, a net increase of EUR 21.4 million. This 
increase is mainly the result of the following 
events: a subsequent capital increase in the 
Joint Venture with SCK-CEN, PanTera NV, for 
an amount of EUR 20.4 million and a convertible 
loan with the same JV for EUR 1.0 million. Besides these transactions, IBA wrote off the 
11.4% (USD 2 million, EUR 1.8 million) stake in 
HIL Applied Medical Ltd, an Israelian developer 
of laser-based proton therapy systems.

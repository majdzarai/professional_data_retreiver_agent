using the Bragg peak called ConformalFLASH. IBAs 
strategy to take FLASH today from research to a clinical 
version of ConformalFLASH will take into consideration the 
radiobiology, clinical safety, and future streamlined workflow 
for FLASH. ConformalFLASH means:. Combining the benefit of FLASH with the benefit of the proton 
Bragg peak.. Dose delivery in 1-2 beams, with no need for multi-field 
delivery, dose-splitting and potentially losing the FLASH effect..

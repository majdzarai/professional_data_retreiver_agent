program seeks to minimize potential adverse 
effects arising from the unpredictability of 
financial markets on the Groups financial 
performance. To this effect, the Group uses 
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain 
risk exposures. Financial risk management is carried out by a 
central treasury department (Group Treasury). The latter issues and enforces written policies. These policies provide written principles related 
to overall financial risk management, as well as 
written policies covering specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, use of derivative and non-
derivative financial instruments. Group Treasury 
identifies, evaluates, and hedges financial risks.

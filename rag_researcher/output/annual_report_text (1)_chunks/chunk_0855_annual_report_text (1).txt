xpected credit loss, the Group uses an allowance matrix based on ageing balances adjusted for forward-
looking factors linked to a specific customer. The matrix used is as follow: 25% after 90 days overdue; 50% after 180 days overdue; 75% after 270 days overdue; 100% after 360 days overdue. The credit loss is further reviewed in detail to take into consideration other customer specific factors such as 
re-negotiation, customer refinancing, and guarantees received. For large Proton Therapy contracts, such analysis is performed considering the overall position of the contract, taking into 
account trade receivable, contract asset and contract liabilities.

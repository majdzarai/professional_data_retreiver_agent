ne of the most advanced forms 
of radiation therapy and a valuable treatment 
modality for thousands of women, men and children 
who are diagnosed with cancer. Proton therapy aims to destroy cancer cells by 
delivering proton beams to a target tumor. Protons 
release the maximum energy within the tumor target 
area while limiting the radiation to the surrounding 
healthy tissues. This is not the case for photon 
radiotherapy, the most common type of radiation 
currently used in cancer therapy.

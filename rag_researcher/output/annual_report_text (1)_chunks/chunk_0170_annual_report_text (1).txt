WASTE
IBA also has an impact on waste production:. A direct impact through our operations: offices and manu- 
facturing processes.. An indirect impact through our installed product base: production processes at our suppliers facilities, transport 
within the value chain, and, once installed at the customer 
location, servicing and decommissioning. We have set ourselves targets for reducing our unsorted waste 
intensity by a factor of 3x below 2018 levels by 2025. This will be achieved by making changes at all levels impacting 
our logistics, manufacturing and offices.

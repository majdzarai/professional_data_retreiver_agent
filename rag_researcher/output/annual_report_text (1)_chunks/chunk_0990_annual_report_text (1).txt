The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognized in equity. Gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized immediately in the income 
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the 
income statement (e.g. when the revenue from the forecast sale that is hedged is recognised).

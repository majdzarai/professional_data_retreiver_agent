------------------------------
This 
assessment is dependent on the nature of the 
services that are required from the supplier and 
on the geographical location of this supplier. By 2023, all new IBA suppliers have recognized 
and signed the Supplier Code of Conduct. No incident with respect to Human Rights 
relating to the IBAs activities or decisions were 
noticed in 2023. A large majority of IBAs facilities are accessible 
to persons with reduced mobility. As an example, the four main buildings in Louvain-la-Neuve are 
fully adapted for such people.

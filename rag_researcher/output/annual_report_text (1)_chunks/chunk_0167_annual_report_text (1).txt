our logistics, manufacturing and offices. Product packaging, for instance, is being continually improved to reduce its overall 
environmental impact. Recently, the warehouse team replaced 
a machine using non-recyclable materials with three new 
ones utilizing recovered or recycled materials. These include 
a padding machine for reusing cardboard boxes, an air cushion 
machine minimizing plastic waste, and a paper compression 
machine utilizing recycled paper. Through the introduction of eco-design practices, our product 
development processes implement the principles of circularity 
 avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle.

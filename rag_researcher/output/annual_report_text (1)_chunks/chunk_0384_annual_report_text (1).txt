dividend paid to its shareholders. A number of 
Profit-Sharing Points is assigned to each IBA 
employee, proportionate to their responsibility 
level. Managing Directors and other Executive 
Management Team members participate to this 
plan alongside with employees. Agreements with the Managing Directors and 
members of the Executive Management Team 
do contain claw-back provisions in relation to any 
payments that would be made based on 
erroneous financial information. Long-term Incentives (LTI) 
IBA issues LTI usually under the form of a Stock 
Option Plan.

Cyclhad SAS 
The Group has a 33.33% interest in Cyclhad 
SAS, which built a proton therapy center that is 
operational since the summer of 2018. IBA has no capital commitments as at December 
31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 to participate 
in any potential future funding of Cyclhad SAS. IBA has therefore not accounted for its share of 
the loss and negative equity of Cyclhad SAS 
beyond its value of the capital invested. Normandy Hadrontherapy SAS 
Since June 2019, IBA ownership in Normandy 
Hadrontherapy SAS remained at 39.81 % (no 
change from 2019) of this entity following 
financing by several public and private players.

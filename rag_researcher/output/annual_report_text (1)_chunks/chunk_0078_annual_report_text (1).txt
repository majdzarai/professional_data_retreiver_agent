ing healthy cells, unlike traditional modalities. The growing number of clinical 
trials (200+) and ongoing increase of new radiotherapeutic 
molecule developments support the great potential of 
radioligand therapy. To enable this revolution, we must enhance the availability of 
novel isotopes and boost their production capacity. The cyclotron 
must play its part as a reliable and sustainable production 
source of isotopes for the radiopharmaceutical industry.

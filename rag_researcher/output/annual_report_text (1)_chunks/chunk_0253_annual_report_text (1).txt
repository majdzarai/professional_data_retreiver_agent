------------------------------
in market 
interest rates relates primarily to the Groups 
long-term debt obligations with floating interest 
rates which were fully repaid in 2023. When the 
Group considers that the fluctuation of interest 
rates could have a significant impact on its 
financial results, the Group will use interest rate 
swaps in order to mitigate this impact. IBA does not apply hedge accounting to these 
transactions, and 
these 
instruments 
are 
therefore revalued through profit and loss. At the end of 2023 and 2022, the Group did not 
have any outstanding interest rate swaps.

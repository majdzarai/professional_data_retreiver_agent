------------------------------
ar visibility on our future performance, and we are confident in our 
ability to grow in the years to come and create value for all our stakeholders. Assuming a stabilization of global supply chain challenges, a return of inflation 
to around 3%, as access conditions to certain regions normalize, and based 
on the prospect of maintaining a high level of order intake, we have issued medium 
term guidance. Subject to these factors, we confirm our expectation that the annual 
revenue growth rate should reach an average of 15% over the 2022-2026 period.

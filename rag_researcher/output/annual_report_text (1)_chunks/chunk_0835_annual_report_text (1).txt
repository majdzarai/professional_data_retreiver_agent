------------------------------
Work in progress relates to the production of 
inventory for which a customer has not yet been 
secured, while contracts assets (note 4.3.1) 
relate to the production for specific customers in 
fulfilling obligations under a signed contract. The inventories have significantly increased in 
2023. This is driven by an increase in customer 
orders, business growth and anticipation of 
production planning requirements. The increase of the provision for write off covers 
general obsolescence as well as the NRV 
adjustment for the inventories related to the 
Dynamitron business being closed as described 
in Note 3.2.

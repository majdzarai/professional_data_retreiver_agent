corruption are considered as potential 
dangers. Being fully aware of this risk for over 25 
years, IBA has since long published a Code of 
Business Conduct. This code defines, among 
other things, the strict framework in which IBA 
conducts business, including unambiguous 
rejection of risks related to corruption and 
bribery. This Code is part of our work policies. Every employee is required to read and pass a 
post-training test to acknowledge clear and full 
understanding and acceptance of the principles.

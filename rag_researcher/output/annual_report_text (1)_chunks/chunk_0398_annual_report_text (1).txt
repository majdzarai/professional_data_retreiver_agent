required. Non-Managing Directors do not receive any form 
of variable remuneration and no other form of 
fixed, equity-based or in-kind remuneration in

annual basis, which may result in an adjustment 
when deemed necessary or appropriate. Managing Directors do not receive specific 
director remuneration.

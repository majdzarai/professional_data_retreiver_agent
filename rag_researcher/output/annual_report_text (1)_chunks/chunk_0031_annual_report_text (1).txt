MAKING MORE ECO-RESPONSIBLE 
SOLUTIONS: A DAILY MISSION
The Rhodotron electric accelerator is the most 
environmentally-friendly option as it avoids the use 
of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials, as well 
as the pollution and hazards associated with them. And yet, IBAs ambition is to go even further. IBA is now 
deploying more resources and investigating further options 
to ensure that the entire solution offered is part of a more 
eco-responsible approach.

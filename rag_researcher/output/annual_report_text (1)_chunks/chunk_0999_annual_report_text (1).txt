------------------------------
We evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls related to revenue recognition 
for this type of contracts, including the estimation of costs incurred and the review of sales 
contracts. For a sample of projects, we obtained the contracts and validated the revenue characteristic 
data by reconciling them to the specific accounting module for project management. Based on 
the planned billing schedule, bank statements related to payments received during the fiscal 
year were requested and obtained through sampling. For the same sample, we also validated the estimated total costs by reconciling them to the 
tracking files and had discussions with project managers.

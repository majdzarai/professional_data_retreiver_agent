Submitted to the General Meeting as candidate independent directors on their election, without excluding the fact that 
other directors also fulfill the independence criteria. None of the independent directors ceased during the financial year to 
fulfill the independence criteria set out in the corporate charte. The Board of Directors considers that the current non-renewable mandate of Mr. Marcel Miller, representing Consultance 
Marcel Miller S.Comm. as independent director is in line with Article 7:87 CCA and will end at the General Meeting of 
2026.

------------------------------
ctors do not receive any form 
of variable remuneration and no other form of 
fixed, equity-based or in-kind remuneration in 
the course of the year. At present, it is not anticipated that the policy will 
fundamentally change over the next two years. Both the level and structure of director 
remuneration are monitored and reviewed on an 
annual basis, which may result in an adjustment 
when deemed necessary or appropriate. Managing Directors do not receive specific 
director remuneration. The remuneration they 
receive for their direct or indirect role in the 
company includes compensation for their 
director responsibilities.

ted by IBA and the Belgian 
Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN, focusing on the development 
and commercialization of radiopharmaceuticals for cancer 
diagnosis and therapy. One of its key areas of research is the use 
of actinium-225, a radioactive isotope that has shown promise 
in the treatment of several types of cancer. Actinium-225 emits 
alpha particles, which are highly effective at killing cancer cells 
while sparing healthy tissues. PanTera is working on developing 
actinium-225-based radiopharmaceuticals to treat a variety 
of cancers, including prostate cancer and multiple myeloma.

on Brabant, as a venture capital partner 
InvestBW is an investment fund representing 
equity and subordinated or convertible loan to 
entrepreneurs. Although it is presumed that, with 25% of the shares, IBA has a significant 
influence over InvestBW, we have rebutted the 
significant influence on the basis that IBA 
currently has made the choice to not participate 
in the decision making process of InvestBW. The investment is accounted for as an equity 
investment financial asset under IFRS9, at fair 
value and gains and losses will be recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income.

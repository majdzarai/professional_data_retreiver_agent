DLE THE GROWTH OF THE MEDICAL 
DEVICE INDUSTRY
The medical device industry has a wide range of products that 
enable patient diagnosis and treatment. Within this large multi-
segment industry, Disposal Medical Devices (DMD) include all 
single-use devices e.g. surgical gloves, dialysis tubes, diabetes 
patches, orthopedic implants, syringes, etc. The medical device sterilization market is projected 
to double within the next decade. Additionally, there is 
a notable shift occurring in the distribution of sterilization 
methods. Previously dominated by ethylene oxide 
and Gamma technologies, the landscape is now 
transitioning towards a more equitable distribution.

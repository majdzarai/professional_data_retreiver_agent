COMMITTED TO OUR EMPLOYEES
As Yves Jongen, IBAs founder, always reminds us, our 
people are IBAs most valuable asset. After all, would our 
mission statement to protect, enhance and save lives still 
make sense if it isnt put into practice for and by our employees? As a responsible employer, we want to provide our employees 
with safe and efficient working conditions and a friendly 
environment conducive to their professional and personal 
development. AT OUR BEST
Peak performance is achieved when we are at our best.

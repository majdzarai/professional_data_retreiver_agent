We are audited once a year by 
our Notified Body. In 2023 we were also 
inspected by the FDA and no observations were 
made. The Sustainability Council in October 2023 
presented the action plan that has been put in 
place along a number of lines, including CO2, waste, diversity and governance, as well as the 
status of each action. A more comprehensive 
review of environmental risks by the Risk 
Management Committee is planned for 2024.

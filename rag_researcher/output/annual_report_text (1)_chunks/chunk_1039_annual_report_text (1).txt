the Company. PATENTS AND TECHNOLOGIES 
IBA is careful to patent all aspects of its 
technology for which a patent provides a 
commercial advantage. In addition, the Company has maintained the 
secrecy of a significant portion of its know-how 
that is not patentable or for which the Company 
believes 
secrecy 
is 
more 
effective 
than 
publication in a patent application. More 
fundamentally, the Company believes that the 
best way to protect itself from its competitors is 
not only by patenting its inventions, but by 
maintaining its technological lead. IBA also licenses patents from third parties and 
pays royalties to them.

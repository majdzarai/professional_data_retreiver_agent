The variable compensation paid in 2023 
relates to 2022 performance year. The plan 
was based on business results vs pre-
defined goals which were measured for 33% 
against Profit Before Tax (PBT), for 33% 
against Order Intake and for 34% on 
Sustainability. The choice of these performance criteria 
contributes to the long term development of 
the company, being a mix of current financial 
performance (backlog conversion), new 
business 
(backlog 
creation) 
and 
stakeholders impact (sustainability). In order to protect its competitive 
position, IBA does not disclose targets.

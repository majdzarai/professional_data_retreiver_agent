system to produce their own radiotracers locally. This reduces the need for long-distance transportation of 
radiotracers, which can be expensive and time-consuming, and enables PET imaging to be more widely available 
in remote areas or regions where access to radio- 
pharmaceuticals may be limited. Overall, the IBA CycloneKEY cyclotron helps make 
PET imaging more widely available worldwide by 
facilitating local production of medical isotopes and 
reducing the logistical challenges associated with the 
transportation of radiotracers.

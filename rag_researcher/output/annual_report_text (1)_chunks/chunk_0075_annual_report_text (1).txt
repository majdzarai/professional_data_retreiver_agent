ces. Nuclear medicine is emerging as a relevant modality to address 
this gap by extending overall survival and quality of life for 
cancer patients. Theranostics and targeted therapies allow 
the administration of radiation directly to the targeted cells, with minimal toxic side effects to surrounding healthy cells, unlike traditional modalities. The growing number of clinical 
trials (200+) and ongoing increase of new radiotherapeutic 
molecule developments support the great potential of 
radioligand therapy. To enable this revolution, we must enhance the availability of 
novel isotopes and boost their production capacity.

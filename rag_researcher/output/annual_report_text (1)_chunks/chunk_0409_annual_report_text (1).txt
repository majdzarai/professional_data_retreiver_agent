At the group level, the Order Intake portion and 
the PBT portion did not generate any payment, and a B-Corp interim assessment by an 
independent body led to a payment of 150. This 
resulted in a final pay-out of 51%. The variable pay is capped at 150% of target 
payment. There was no need to apply this cap 
for performance year 2023. Score

performance is achieved when we are at our best. Accordingly a complete set of tools and practices is in place, covering the areas of performance management (working 
collaboratively), engagement monitoring (constant dialogue), learning (develop knowledge and skills) and compensation 
(sharing value created).. I am convinced that in future, talented individuals will list 
sustainable development as 
an essential criterion in their 
choice of employer. Olivier Legrain, Chief Executive Officer

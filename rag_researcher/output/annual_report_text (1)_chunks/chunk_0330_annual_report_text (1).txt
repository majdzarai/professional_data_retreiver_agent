of Mr. Pierre Mottet. On each occasion, the 
Committee reported on its meetings to the Board 
of Directors. The main topics addressed were 
the financial results, liquidity situation, analysis 
of the external auditors' review, examination of 
the 2024 budget, and follow-up of internal audit 
and risk management. The Company keeps close control of the risks to 
which it is subject through its financial controllers 
employed in each of the divisions. This enables 
the risks to be managed closely.

7.4.1 Derivatives financial 
instruments 
Some of these financial instruments are 
designated as hedging instruments as they 
hedge specific exchange rate risks to which the 
Group is exposed. Hedge accounting has been 
applied to these contracts because they are 
deemed to be highly effective hedges. Those 
transactions are highly probable as they are 
linked to existing contracts.

meet company requirements.. empower all employees to stop any activity which they judge 
to be hazardous and that goes against our No Harm principle. Through all steps of the development, implementation, and operation of IBA products and services, we ensure 
the highest safety standards for our employees. At IBA, we recognize that time out of the office can be beneficial. We partner with local associations to offer our employees 
refreshing team building or individual activities during 
lunchtime. Social clubs are promoted by IBA and organized by 
voluntary employees.

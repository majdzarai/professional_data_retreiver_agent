not met. Tax incentives: R&D tax credit: IBA is eligible for a tax credit on the R&D investments and the tax credits are carried forward up to 5

R&D expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As most of these tax credits are not immediately utilizable by 
IBA SA, a long-term asset is recognised.

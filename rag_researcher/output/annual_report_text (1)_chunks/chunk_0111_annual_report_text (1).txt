SAFE MEDICAL IMAGING: QUALITY 
ASSURANCE FOR A BETTER DIAGNOSIS
IBA quality assurance solutions for medical imaging systems 
such as X-ray or CT (Computed Tomography) contribute 
to improving image quality. This ensures a more accurate 
diagnosis and therapy, while also controlling the radiation 
dose released by the machine. Dosimetry solutions offer 
a complete and instant analysis of the released dose to complete 
the required test efficiency and with the highest precision.

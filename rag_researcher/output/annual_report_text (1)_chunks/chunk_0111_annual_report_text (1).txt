nd the success of their treatment depend upon it. In medical imaging, the objective is to reduce patient exposure 
to radiation, while maintaining good image quality. In radiotherapy and proton therapy, the goal is to expose tumors 
with millimeter precision to a high dose of rays, while reducing 
the exposure to healthy tissue as much as possible. In each case, the accuracy of the equipment and the control 
of the dose are of paramount importance. To achieve this, dosimetry instruments and software are needed to calibrate 
and control the diagnostic and therapeutic equipment.

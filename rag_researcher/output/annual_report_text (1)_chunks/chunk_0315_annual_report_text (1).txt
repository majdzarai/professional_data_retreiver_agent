Mrs. Christine Dubus. Sustainability board meeting 
The sustainability committee was set-up in 2018 
as an IBA Board Committee. That committee met once on October 19, 2023, to define the strategy and ambition of IBA on the 
Sustainability fronts which is, at IBA, defined 
through commitments to our 5 stakeholders: our 
customers and their patients, our employees, our shareholders, society, and the planet. Since 
October

Committee is considered as a full board meeting 
with sustainability as a specific topic, as 
sustainability is key for IBAs strategy. The name 
has been changed to Sustainability Board.

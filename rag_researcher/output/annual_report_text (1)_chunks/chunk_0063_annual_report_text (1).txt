World Health Organization1 (WHO) figures from 2022 
indicate that 10 million people die from cancer each 
year, and yet patients lives and chances of survival are 
significantly improved if the cancer is detected early. In fact, a cancer diagnosed at an earlier stage is more likely 
to be treated successfully, resulting in a higher likelihood 
of survival, reduction of morbidity and lower cost of care.

t income taxes: Management is not expecting that the requirements of Pillar II will be applicable to IBA Group as the turnover threshold is 
not met. Tax incentives: R&D tax credit: IBA is eligible for a tax credit on the R&D investments and the tax credits are carried forward up to 5 
years (4 years until 2022), after which point these are reimbursed. IBA accounts for these as a direct deduction from the 
R&D expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As most of these tax credits are not immediately utilizable by 
IBA SA, a long-term asset is recognised.

Here below are the latest data 15-02-2024 at the 
group level. The graph shows the average of the 
ratio 
between 
ABS+ (annual 
base 
salary 
excluding bonuses) and the local base rate 
salary. The conclusion of these analyses is that IBA's 
policy is not only respectful of women and men 
but tends to respect all people without 
distinction, across the groups. Note: small 
number may distort comparison especially 
above grade 12.

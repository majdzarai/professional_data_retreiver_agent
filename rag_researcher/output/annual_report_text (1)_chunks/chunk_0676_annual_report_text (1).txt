controlled subsidiaries are consolidated in full. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power 
over 
the 
entity. Subsidiaries 
are 
fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred 
to 
the 
Group. They 
are 
deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases.

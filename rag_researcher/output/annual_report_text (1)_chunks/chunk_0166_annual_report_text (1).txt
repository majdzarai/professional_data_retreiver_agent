reduces the CO2 footprint per functional 
unit of its installed base by increasing the energy efficiency 
and reducing the mass of its product portfolio. The ProteusONE proton therapy system has significantly 
improved energy performance thanks to the use of super- 
conductivity. Our RadioPharma Solutions division offers the CycloneKIUBE, with significantly greater compactness (less resources used) 
and energy efficiency. Our Industrial Solutions division has developed the new 
generation Rhodotron, the energy performance of which has 
greatly improved.

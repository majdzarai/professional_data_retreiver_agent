The adjustment for individual balances overdue 
by more than 360 days EUR 44.7 million is 
driven by 4 ProtonTherapy equipment projects 
and no allowance for credit loss has been 
recognised for various reasons, such as projects 
on hold with limited exposure, post balance 
sheet payments, arbitration procedures ongoing 
etc. These are followed closely by Management 
who is confident in the ability of IBA to recover 
these balances.

the last two years: Accounting policy for trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are held by IBA to collect the related cash flows. Trade receivables, other receivables and 
prepayment are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method less impairment losses. Most of the time, the discounting impact is not significant and receivables are therefore measured at nominal value. In calculating, the expected credit loss, the Group uses an allowance matrix based on ageing balances adjusted for forward-
looking factors linked to a specific customer.

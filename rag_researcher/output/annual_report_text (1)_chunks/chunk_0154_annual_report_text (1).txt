ENGAGING WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
We believe that a strong and responsible supply chain benefits 
our community. IBA has more than 100 main suppliers worldwide supporting 
its design and product manufacturing. The majority of IBA 
suppliers are located in Europe. IBA suppliers have been 
selected for their ability to best comply with requirements as 
stipulated by ISO 13485:2016. The selection and qualification 
process of a supplier considers the criticality of the supplied 
goods and services.

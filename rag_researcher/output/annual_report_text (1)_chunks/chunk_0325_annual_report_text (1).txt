ement. IBA is committed 
to providing equal employment and training 
opportunities, and to treating applicants and 
employees without discrimination. We do not 
discriminate based on race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, language, or disabilities. Our policy is that no one 
at IBA should ever be subject to any kind of 
discrimination. This in the end leads to a feeling of 
connectedness which we define as Belonging. It 
is the feeling for an individual to be integral part 
of IBA, an organization where we all can feel at 
our best everywhere, every day.

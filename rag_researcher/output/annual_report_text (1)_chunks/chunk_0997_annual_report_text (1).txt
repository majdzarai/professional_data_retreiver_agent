As described in Note 4.3 regarding revenue recognition, the Group applies the percentage of 
completion method to determine revenue recognition during the execution of a project. This 
percentage is determined by comparing the costs incurred to the total expected cost of the project. Evaluating this data requires judgment, which involves regular estimates of future costs associated 
with ongoing projects, excluding certain direct costs not related to project progress, and analyzing 
additional billing in case of variations. The Group's management relies on the knowledge of project 
managers, the granularity of its internal control system, and the experience gained from completed 
projects.

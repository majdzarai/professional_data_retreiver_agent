IBA Annual Report 2023 
120. 2. Significant events in the period and 
accounting estimates and judgements 
2.1. DIRECT FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF RUSSIAS 
INVASION OF UKRAINE
Early 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to 
a myriad of economic and other sanctions 
against Russia, some of which also impact the 
functioning of IBA. IBA has a subsidiary in Russia employing about 
25 employees, whose operations have been 
maintained to ensure the operation and 
maintenance of a proton therapy center in 
Dimitrovgrad; the maintenance contract for this 
center has been renewed in 2023 for another 
year. At the same time, the installation of the 
last treatment room is still ongoing.

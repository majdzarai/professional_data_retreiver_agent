Cyclhad SAS 
The Group has a 33.33% interest in Cyclhad 
SAS, which built a proton therapy center that is 
operational since the summer of 2018. IBA has no capital commitments as at December 
31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 to participate 
in any potential future funding of Cyclhad SAS. IBA has therefore not accounted for its share of 
the loss and negative equity of Cyclhad SAS 
beyond its value of the capital invested.

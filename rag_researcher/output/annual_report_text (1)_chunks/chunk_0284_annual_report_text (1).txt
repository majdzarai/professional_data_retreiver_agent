ategic plan, and 
follow-up on investments and treasury are 
presented to the Audit Committee before being 
submitted 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors. Furthermore, the Board of Directors is regularly 
informed about the financial state of the Group 
via monthly management dashboards. The communication of financial information to 
the market is managed by the communication, finance, and 
legal 
departments 
of 
the 
organization. Shareholder concentration in the 
Belgian market allows this process to be 
centralized with a limited number of people, with 
the CFO playing a leading role.

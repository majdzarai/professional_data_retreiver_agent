------------------------------
ical solutions allow in-house customers or contract sterilizers to sterilize medical devices either by E-beam in boxes or X-ray in 
pallets, or both. They offer an readily available and ecological alternative to classical sterilisation processes, by eliminating the toxic waste linked to 
chemical inputs such as ethylene oxide gas and nuclear materials such as cobalt 60. They avoid the associated pollutants and hazards. === Page 197 ===

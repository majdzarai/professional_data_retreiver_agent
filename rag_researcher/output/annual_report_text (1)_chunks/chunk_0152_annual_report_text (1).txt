with universities and high schools. We have an active policy 
of integrating young people into professional life, by offering 
internships, end-of-study work, and student jobs. IBA mainly 
hires local employees in the countries where it has operations, creating jobs and providing wages to residents in the nearby 
area, and thus boosting the local economy. This is our way of 
making a positive contribution to the future of society at large, and of attracting new talent to IBA.

the law, and the 2020 Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board and the Nomination Committee fully 
acknowledge the benefits of diversity among 
employees, within the Executive Management 
Team, and within the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2023, more than one third 
of the directors are of the other gender which 
means 
that 
the 
Company 
meets 
the 
requirements on gender diversity. The age distribution within the management 
team is quite broad, indicating a fair and 
balanced 
value 
between 
said 
members.

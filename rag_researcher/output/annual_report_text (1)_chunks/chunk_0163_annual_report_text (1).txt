Inspired by the EU climate targets we have set ourselves goals 
for reducing our operations net GHG emissions to zero by 2030. This means taking action on our infrastructure and mobility 
impacts to reduce them by at least 50% below 2018 levels by 2030, and for the remaining part, via decarbonization contribution. Green energy contracts are in place, and renewable energy 
autoproduction capacity such photovoltaic carports now 
enhance our headquarter facilities to further increase the ratio 
of low impact renewable energy consumption.

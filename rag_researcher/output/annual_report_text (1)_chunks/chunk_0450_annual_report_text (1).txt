azardous and goes against the No Harm 
principle. The Code also defines working times 
that cannot be exceeded, even if local rules and 
regulations allow for such excess. Other internal 
policies ensure a high level of safety for all 
employees (e.g. the Working at Height Policy, the PPE Matrix Policy, the Global Radiation 
Safety Policy, the LOTO Policy, the Electrical 
Policy,). The implementation, monitoring, and 
updating of these policies are discussed in the 
Committee for Protection and Prevention at 
Work.

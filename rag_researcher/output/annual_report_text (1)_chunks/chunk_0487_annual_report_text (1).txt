maintenance 
of 
photovoltaic 
renewable 
energy production means (taxonomy category 
7.6) 
When it comes to the electricity expenses related 
to hybrid (PHEV) and electric vehicles (EV), per 
the same rationale as for the capital expenditure, IBA 
identically 
acknowledges 
that 
more 
information is needed about the full life cycle of 
the said vehicles to ensure that the technical 
screening criteria are met. IBA therefore deems 
them to be not taxonomy-aligned. === Page 93 ===

PT revenues increased by 4.7% to EUR 229.1 
million (2022: EUR 218.8 million), driven by the 
anticipated acceleration of revenue recognition 
in the second half. Equipment revenues 
increased by 3% as contracts were converted to 
revenues from the backlog, with five projects 
under installation during the period. This was 
further supported by PT Services growth with 
two new centers in the USA and Italy starting to 
treat patients in 2023.

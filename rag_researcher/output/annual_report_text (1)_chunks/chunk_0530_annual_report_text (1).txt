------------------------------
eased substantially year-on-year, from EUR 346.1 million in 2022 to EUR 449.4 
million in 2023, predominantly due to an 
increased level of activity. The operating profit amounted to EUR 17.3 
million in 2023 against a loss of EUR -6.6 million 
in 2022, a net increase of EUR 23.9 million. This 
is again driven by a higher activity level, hence 
higher gross margin, but also by higher 
investments by the company to remain ready for 
the future, which partially offsets the postive 
trend in the margin. Operating expenses increased by EUR 81.6 
million in 2023 to EUR 434.3 million.

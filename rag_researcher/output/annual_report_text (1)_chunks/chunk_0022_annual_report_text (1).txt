orms of radiotherapy in cancer treatments using 
ionizing rays. Thanks to the unique properties 
of protons, tumors can be targeted more 
accurately. In effect, protons deposit the majority 
of their energy in a controlled zone, limiting 
exposure of the surrounding healthy tissues 
to potentially harmful radiation. RadioPharma Solutions develops products that 
are used for producing isotopes and radio-
pharmaceuticals, vital for use in cancer diagnosis, as well as in the cardiology and neurology fields. We assist hospitals and radiopharmaceutical 
product distribution centers by helping them 
design, build and operate their radiopharmacy 
units.

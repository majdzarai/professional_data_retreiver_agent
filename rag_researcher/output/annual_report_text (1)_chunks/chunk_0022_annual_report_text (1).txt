in the field of proton therapy. Proton therapy 
is considered to be one of the most advanced 
forms of radiotherapy in cancer treatments using 
ionizing rays. Thanks to the unique properties 
of protons, tumors can be targeted more 
accurately. In effect, protons deposit the majority 
of their energy in a controlled zone, limiting 
exposure of the surrounding healthy tissues 
to potentially harmful radiation.

------------------------------
diotheranostics can be used 
to treat a wide range of cancers, including neuroendocrine 
tumors, prostate cancer, and certain types of breast cancer. Overall, radiotheranostics represents a promising avenue for 
cancer care that is gaining increasing attention from health 
care professionals and researchers alike. As more research is conducted in this area, it is expected 
that radiotheranostics will continue to play an important role 
in the fight against cancer. This theranostic principle has acquired greater importance in 
personalized medicine in recent years, particularly in oncology, where advanced tumors can potentially be treated effectively 
with low side effects.

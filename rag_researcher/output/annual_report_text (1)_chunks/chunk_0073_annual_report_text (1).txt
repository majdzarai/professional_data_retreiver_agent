A COMBINATION OF DIAGNOSIS AND 
THERAPY: THERANOSTICS
Radiotheranostics is a type of cancer treatment that combines 
diagnostic imaging with targeted radiation therapy. It involves 
the use of radiopharmaceuticals, which are compounds that 
contain both a radioactive isotope and a targeting molecule. These radiopharmaceuticals are injected into the patients 
bloodstream and travel to cancer cells, where they can be 
detected using imaging techniques such as PET or SPECT.

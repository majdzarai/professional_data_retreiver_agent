However, the use of PET imaging is limited by the availability 
of radiotracers, which require the production of medical 
isotopes. The IBA CycloneKEY cyclotron addresses this issue 
by providing a compact and efficient system for the production 
of FDG, commonly used in PET imaging. The CycloneKEYs compact size and advanced automation 
features make it ideal for small to medium-sized 
radiopharmacies and research institutions, which can 
use the system to produce their own radiotracers locally.

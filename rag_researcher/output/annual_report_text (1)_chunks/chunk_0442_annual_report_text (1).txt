options to report non-compliance with 
the Code. In December 2021, a whistleblower 
platform in line with European and international 
standards was activated on the Companys 
website. The platform thus provides IBAs 
stakeholders with the possibility to anonimously 
report alleged violations of the Code of Business 
Conduct in addition to the existing Company 
channels. Complaints are managed by the 
Compliance Officer who remains the central 
point of contact with the responsibility to monitor 
compliance and follow up on reported incidents 
of non-compliance.

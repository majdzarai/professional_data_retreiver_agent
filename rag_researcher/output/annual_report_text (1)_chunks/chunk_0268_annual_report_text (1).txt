Report where and why it deviates 
from the Code. The Charter was endorsed by IBAs Board of 
Directors during its meeting held on 18th 
December 2020. The Charter may be updated 
from time to time as governance of the Company 
evolves. According to section 3:6, 2, 2, of the BCAC, IBA reports that it deviates from principle 5.3/1 of 
the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code, which states that the Nomination Committee 
should be composed of a majority of non-
executive, independent, directors. The 
explanation for such a deviation is that IBA has 
a particular shareholder structure to preserve 
and secure its anchorage in Belgium.

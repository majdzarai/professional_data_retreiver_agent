required to make 
estimates and judgements that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The application of accounting policies requires 
judgements 
that 
impact 
the 
amounts 
recognised. Additionally, amounts recognised 
are based on factors that are by default 
associated with uncertainty. Actual results may 
therefore 
differ 
from 
estimates. Where 
applicable, the estimates and judgements are 
described per note within the consolidated 
financial statements.

for PET and SPECT isotopes from 13 MeV to 30 MeV. Currently, there are still a large number of patients for whom 
cancer treatment fails, despite major scientific advances. Nuclear medicine is emerging as a relevant modality to address 
this gap by extending overall survival and quality of life for 
cancer patients. Theranostics and targeted therapies allow 
the administration of radiation directly to the targeted cells, with minimal toxic side effects to surrounding healthy cells, unlike traditional modalities.

The hedging reserves include changes in the fair 
value of financial instruments used to hedge 
cash flows of future transactions. Hedging 
reserves have increased in 2023 following 
fluctuation in the foreign currencies as well as 
ineffective 
portions 
of 
instruments 
being 
released to the Income Statement. The treasury shares reserve includes shares of 
IBA S.A. acquired by group entities and are 
valued at acquisition cost. Most of these shares 
are held by the Group to cover the Stock Option 
Plans and have been acquired in the previous 
years with the aim of hedging against share price 
fluctuations.

Local taxation exposure 
Since 2015, the Company initiated an analysis on the Groups exposure in countries other than Belgium to be potentially 
obliged to pay certain local taxes whereas the payment of those taxes has been transferred to the Groups customers. The 
exposure identified as of December 31, 2015, was reduced as a result of further investigations. Management is monitoring 
this risk closely and regularly, however, based on the data available today, it is still not possible to make a reliable estimate 
of the remaining exposure and therefore no provision has been accrued for in the Groups financial statements.

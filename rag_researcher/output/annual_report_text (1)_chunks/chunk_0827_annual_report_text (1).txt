novel, patented approach to particle acceleration and 
delivery, combining nano-technology with ultra-
high-intensity lasers and ultra-fast magnets. This potential technological breakthrough could 
enable a meaningful reduction in the size and 
cost of proton therapy systems without 
compromising clinical utility. Alongside this 
investment, IBA and HIL have signed an 
Original 
Equipment 
Manufacturer 
(OEM) 
agreement which gives IBA the right to 
purchase HILs laser-based proton accelerators 
for the purpose of integrating them into proton 
therapy solutions.

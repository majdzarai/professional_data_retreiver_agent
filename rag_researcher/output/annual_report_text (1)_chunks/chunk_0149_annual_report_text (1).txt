COMMITTED TO SOCIETY
We firmly believe that the purpose of an economic player 
must be to promote social progress and collective well-being. The model we endorse - both externally and internally - goes 
beyond regulatory compliance: it encourages an ethical 
vision of practices and behavior, respect for differences 
and a meaningful contribution to the communities around us. A big thank you for the greater 
choice offered by the new bike lease 
formula, for the bike allowance and 
the excellent infrastructure at IBA.

upgrade of energy efficient equipments 
(taxonomy category 7.3) 
When it comes to long term lease of hybrid 
(PHEV) and electrical vehicles (EV), IBA 
currently has limited insight into the full life cycle 
of the said vehicles (materials production and 
recyclability, consumables (such tires), waste 
management) and acknowledges that more 
information is needed to ensure that the 
technical screening criteria are met. Hence, for 
these taxonomy-eligible activities, IBA currently 
deems them to be not taxonomy-aligned.

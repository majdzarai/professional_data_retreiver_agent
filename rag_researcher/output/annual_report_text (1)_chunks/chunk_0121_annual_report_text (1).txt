------------------------------
our Stakeholder Approach, we at IBA believe 
in a business model that is a force for good, creating shared 
and long-term value for all stakeholders. We also firmly 
believe that being a business that is a force for good is 
the best business choice to attract and retain talent, stay ahead 
of upcoming risks, and improve the current product catalog 
while exploring new and growing markets. Beyond words, we just renewed our commitment to make 
this a key part of our operations by recertifying for the second 
time as a B Corporation (or B Corp).

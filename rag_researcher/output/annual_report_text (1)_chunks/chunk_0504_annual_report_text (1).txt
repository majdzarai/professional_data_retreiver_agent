n the future. For 2023, no 
changes are expected. However, as of reporting 
year 2024 the corporate sustainability reporting 
directive will become effective with subsequent 
reporting obligations, but probably based on GRI 
standards. The corporate sustainability due 
diligence duties are still in draft form but may 
come into effect as of 2025. IBA is well prepared 
for 
this 
evolution 
in 
sustainability/finance 
reporting.

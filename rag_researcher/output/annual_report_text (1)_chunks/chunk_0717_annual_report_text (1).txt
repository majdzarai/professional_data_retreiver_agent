elop, produce and distribute the 
isotope Ac.225. The R&D project is still at a 
very early stage but the JV has secured some 
early supply of Ac.225 via a partnership with 
TerraPower Isotopes. In 2023, both IBA and SCK-CEN made further 
equal contributions to the capital of PanTera 
SA/NV. IBA contributed EUR 16.0 million in 
cash which has been used immediately by 
Pantera to purchase a Rhodotron from IBA. The transaction is considered as a quasi 
apport by Belgian Company Law, hence 
assimilated as a contribution in kind.

------------------------------
ver the long term, we will continue to support partnerships 
with NGOs, foundations and universities which will help improve 
learning and education. In 2023, IBA renewed its collaboration 
with Foundation for Future Generations, as a partner of the Hera 
Awards program, with the Philippe de Woot Awards, and with 
the University of Louvain by supporting the Civil Biomedical 
Engineer diploma program, enabling the Louvain School of 
Engineering (Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain - EPL) to expand 
its range of courses. IBA employees regularly share their experience and knowledge 
with universities and high schools.

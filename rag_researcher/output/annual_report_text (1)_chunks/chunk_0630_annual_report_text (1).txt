in a Sale and Leaseback 
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS16,, specifying the measurement of lease liability in 
a Sale and Leaseback transaction. The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 
2024 
and 
must 
be 
applied 
retrospectively to transaction entered into after 
the initial application of IFRS 16. The amendments are not expected to have an 
impact on the the Groups financial statements 
as IBA has not entered into Sales and 
Leaseback transactions.

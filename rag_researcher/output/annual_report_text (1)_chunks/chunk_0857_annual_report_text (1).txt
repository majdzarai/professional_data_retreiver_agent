Value in use and goodwill impairment test: When management considers that there is a risk of impairment, the recoverable amounts of tangible and intangible assets 
are determined on a value in use basis. Value in use is determined on the basis of cash-flows coming from IBAs most 
recent business plans (4-years horizon), as approved by the Board of Directors in the context of the strategic plan. These 
plans incorporate various assumptions made by management and approved by the Board as to how the business, profit 
margins, and investments will evolve.

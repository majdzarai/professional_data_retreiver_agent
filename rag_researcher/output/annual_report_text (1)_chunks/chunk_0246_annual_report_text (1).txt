IBA Annual Report 2023 
54. IBA 
features are tested on a customer site, during 
installation as well as operations and can 
potentially impact customer operations for the 
tests, as well as potential corrections of non-
conformities. A Hypercare process is in place to 
alleviate those impacts, improve follow-up of the 
new developments as well as accelerate the 
return of experience/customer feedback directly 
to the product development teams.

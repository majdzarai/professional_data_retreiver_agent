IBA Annual Report 2023 
143. 5.3. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
IBA does not have tangible nor intangible 
assets with indefinite useful life, other than 
goodwill. Despite 
the 
macro-economic 
conditions and other events of the year 
described in Note 2, IBA did not identify any 
indication of impairment on assets in 2023 and 
2022 financial years. 5.3.1 Goodwill impairment 
testing: The goodwill recognised on the acquisition of 
Modus Medical Devices Inc, relates to the 
Dosimetry business and has been added to the 
CGU of Dosimetry given the cross synergies that 
will arise from this acquisition.

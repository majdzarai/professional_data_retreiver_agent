IBA delivered a solid performance in the second half 
of 2023, resulting in a positive recurring earnings 
before interest and taxes (REBIT) margin for the full 
year, as anticipated. Industrial and RadioPharma 
Solutions business units have had a particularly 
strong year, with revenues growing more than 50% 
and a significant increase in REBIT driven by high 
order intake over the past few years and accelerated 
backlog conversion. Dosimetry performance was 
also strong, with growth in sales and REBIT, and 
the Services business continuing to perform well 
across the group.
